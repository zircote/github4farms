## Session Delivery Procedure

**Total Duration:** 2.5 hours (150 minutes)
**Structure:** Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation)

---

### Phase 1: Opening & Context Setting (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Establish relevance, review objectives, activate prior knowledge

**Steps:**

1. **Welcome & Attendance (3 minutes)**
   - Greet learners as they arrive
   - Have learners sign attendance sheet
   - Invite learners to grab coffee/snacks if available

2. **Icebreaker / Check-In (3 minutes)**
   - "How did the practice task go this week? Anyone want to share?"
   - Celebrate small wins: "Great work! That's exactly what we want to see."
   - Normalize challenges: "Technology can be tricky; let's troubleshoot together later."

3. **Why This Matters: Farm Context (5 minutes)** *(Andragogy: Need to Know)*
   - Share concrete farm scenario showing problem GitHub solves
   - **Example (Session 2: Issues):** "Last week, I talked to a farmer who lost track of which fields needed re-seeding. Tasks were scattered across sticky notes, texts, and memory. By the time they checked, it was too late. GitHub Issues would have kept all that in one place with reminders."
   - Connect to learners' experiences: "Has this ever happened to you?"

4. **Learning Objectives Review (2 minutes)**
   - Display slide with session objectives written in learner-friendly language
   - **Example:** "By the end of today, you'll be able to create a GitHub issue for a farm task, assign it to yourself, and add it to a project board."
   - Ask: "Sound good? Any questions before we dive in?"

5. **Agenda Overview (2 minutes)**
   - "Here's what we'll do today: First, I'll show you how it works. Then we'll try it together. Then you'll practice on your own. Finally, we'll share what you learned."
   - "We'll take a 10-minute break halfway through."

---

### Phase 2: Instructor Demonstration (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Model the skill with clear narration *(Kolb: Concrete Experience via observation)*

**Facilitation Approach: "I Do"**

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Demonstration (2 minutes)**
   - Project instructor screen on monitor/projector
   - Narrate every action: "I'm clicking on the 'Issues' tab at the top."
   - Use slow, deliberate mouse movements and large cursor (accessibility)
   - Zoom in on relevant screen areas (ensure visibility from back of room)

2. **Execute Demonstration (10 minutes)**
   - Walk through the skill step-by-step with narration
   - **Example (Creating an Issue):**
     - "First, I navigate to my farm project repository."
     - "Then I click the 'Issues' tab."
     - "I click the green 'New Issue' button on the right."
     - "I type a clear title: 'Fix broken fence in north pasture.'"
     - "In the description box, I add details: 'Fence posts damaged by storm. Need replacement before cattle rotation next week.'"
     - "I assign the issue to myself by clicking 'Assignees' and selecting my name."
     - "I add a label by clicking 'Labels' and choosing 'Urgent.'"
     - "Finally, I click 'Submit new issue.' Done!"
   - Pause at each step: "Everyone see that? Any questions?"

3. **Highlight Key Concepts (3 minutes)**
   - Summarize what was demonstrated: "So, an issue is like a digital task card. It keeps all the information in one place."
   - Point out important details: "Notice the issue got a number? That's GitHub's way of keeping track."
   - Use agricultural analogy: "Think of issues like individual animals in a herd management system. Each one has an ID and details."

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Avoid jargon; use plain language
- If demonstration error occurs, acknowledge it: "Oops, I clicked the wrong thing. Let me fix that. You'll make mistakes too—that's normal!"
- Check for understanding: "Is everyone following so far? Thumbs up if you're good, thumbs sideways if you need me to repeat something."

---

### Phase 3: Guided Practice (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Learners perform the skill with instructor support *(Kolb: Concrete Experience via participation)*

**Facilitation Approach: "We Do Together"**

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Practice (5 minutes)**
   - "Now it's your turn to try with my guidance. Get your device ready and log into GitHub."
   - Circulate room to ensure everyone is logged in (troubleshoot login issues)
   - Display step-by-step checklist on projector for reference

2. **Step-by-Step Guided Practice (20 minutes)**
   - Walk learners through the same task demonstrated earlier, one step at a time
   - **Example:**
     - **Instructor:** "Everyone, navigate to your repository. Click on the 'Issues' tab. Give a thumbs up when you're there."
     - **Wait for thumbs up; assist struggling learners.**
     - **Instructor:** "Great! Now click the green 'New Issue' button. Let me know when you see the form."
     - **Continue step-by-step through entire task.**
   - Pause frequently to check for understanding: "Everyone with me so far?"
   - Pair advanced learners with novices: "If you're done early, help your neighbor."

3. **Troubleshoot in Real-Time (5 minutes)**
   - Address common errors as they arise: "If you don't see the 'New Issue' button, make sure you're on the 'Issues' tab, not 'Code.'"
   - Use mistakes as teaching moments: "Great question! Let's figure this out together."
   - Encourage peer assistance: "Has anyone solved this problem? Can you share how?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Move slowly; don't rush learners
- Use "think-aloud" prompts: "Talk me through what you're doing. What do you see on your screen?"
- Celebrate progress: "You're doing great! This is exactly how you learn."

---

### Phase 4: Break (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Reduce cognitive fatigue, allow informal peer discussion

**Steps:**
- Announce break: "Let's take a 10-minute break. Stretch, grab a snack, chat with your neighbor about what you've learned so far."
- Leave demonstration screen visible for reference
- Remain available for informal questions during break

---

### Phase 5: Independent Practice (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Learners apply the skill independently *(Kolb: Active Experimentation)*

**Facilitation Approach: "You Do Alone"**

**Steps:**

1. **Introduce Practice Task (5 minutes)**
   - Distribute lab worksheets
   - Explain the task: "Now you'll create a GitHub issue for a real farm task. Choose something you actually need to track this week."
   - Provide examples: "It could be equipment maintenance, a planting reminder, a supply order, a field observation—anything."
   - Clarify success criteria: "You're successful when you've created an issue with a clear title, description, assignee, and label."

2. **Independent Work Time (30 minutes)**
   - Learners work at their own pace on their devices
   - Instructor circulates room to provide individual support
   - Encourage peer collaboration: "If you're stuck, ask your neighbor first. Then raise your hand for me."
   - Monitor for cognitive overload: If many learners are struggling, pause and do a group clarification
   - Track progress on assessment checklist (for Kirkpatrick Level 2 measurement)

3. **Advanced Challenge (Optional, 5 minutes)**
   - For learners who finish early: "Try creating a second issue and linking it to a project board. Here's how..." (provide brief advanced guidance)
   - Alternative: "Help a neighbor who's still working on the main task."

4. **Wrap-Up Independent Practice (5 minutes)**
   - "Let's pause here. Everyone save your work."
   - Quick check: "Raise your hand if you successfully created an issue." (Count for success metrics)
   - Address outstanding questions: "What was tricky? What do you still need help with?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Resist urge to over-help; let learners struggle productively before intervening
- Use Socratic questioning: "What do you think happens if you click that button?"
- Document common struggles for curriculum iteration (SAM methodology)

---

### Phase 6: Peer Sharing & Reflection (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Reinforce learning through reflection and peer teaching *(Kolb: Reflective Observation)*

**Steps:**

1. **Pair-Share Activity (7 minutes)**
   - "Turn to your neighbor and show them the issue you created. Explain what you did."
   - Pairs take turns presenting their work to each other
   - Instructor circulates and listens for insights

2. **Group Discussion (5 minutes)**
   - "What did you notice when you created the issue? What was easier or harder than expected?"
   - "How is this different from how you currently track tasks?"
   - "Who can share one thing they learned from their partner?"
   - Capture insights on flip chart

3. **Reflection Prompt (3 minutes)** *(Kolb: Abstract Conceptualization)*
   - "So, what's the big idea here? Why are GitHub issues useful for farms?"
   - Facilitate discussion until learners articulate key concepts: "Issues centralize information, create accountability, provide history, enable collaboration."
   - Connect to broader pattern: "This is a tool for organized record-keeping—a skill you can apply to lots of farm management challenges."

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Honor all contributions; avoid correcting minor misunderstandings unless critical
- Use agricultural analogies to reinforce concepts: "Issues are like ear tags for tasks—each one has an ID and tracks details over time."

---

### Phase 7: Application Assignment & Closure (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Plan real-world application between sessions *(Kolb: Active Experimentation)*

**Steps:**

1. **Introduce Application Assignment (3 minutes)**
   - "Here's your homework for this week: Use GitHub to track at least one real farm task between now and our next session."
   - Provide specific guidance: "Create an issue, work on the task, and update the issue when it's done. We'll share our experiences next time."
   - Distribute take-home materials: Quick-reference guide with "How to Create an Issue" steps

2. **Preview Next Session (2 minutes)**
   - "Next session, we'll learn [next topic]. We'll build on what you learned today by [connection to current session]."
   - Generate curiosity: "You'll be able to [exciting capability]."

3. **Q&A and Parking Lot Review (3 minutes)**
   - "Any final questions before we wrap up?"
   - Review "parking lot" flip chart: "We captured a few questions earlier. Let me address those now." (Answer or defer to next session)

4. **Appreciation & Encouragement (2 minutes)**
   - "You all did great work today. Learning new technology is hard, and you showed up and tried. That's what matters."
   - "Keep practicing this week. Make mistakes. Ask questions. I'm here to help."
   - Remind learners of contact information: "Text or email me anytime."

---

### Phase 8: Session Feedback Survey (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Collect Kirkpatrick Level 1 (Reaction) data

**Steps:**
- Distribute session feedback survey forms (or provide digital link)
- "Please take 5 minutes to fill out this short survey. Your feedback helps me improve the training."
- Collect completed surveys before learners leave
- Thank learners for their participation

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Purpose:** Quick-reference guide for handling frequent technical and learning challenges during sessions

---

### Issue 1: Learner Cannot Log Into GitHub

**Symptoms:** Error message "Incorrect password," "Account not found," or repeated failed login attempts

**Causes:**
- Forgotten password
- Account not yet created
- Typing error (common with autofill or caps lock)
- Browser cache/cookie issue

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verify Account Exists:**
   - Ask: "Did you create a GitHub account before today's session?"
   - If no: "Let's create one now. Go to github.com and click 'Sign Up.'" (Assist with account creation: username, email, password)

2. **Reset Password:**
   - If yes: "Let's reset your password. Click 'Forgot password?' on the login screen."
   - Learner receives reset email; check spam folder if not in inbox
   - Assist with password reset process (check email, click link, create new password)

3. **Check Typing Errors:**
   - "Let's try typing your password again slowly. Make sure caps lock is off."
   - Suggest using "Show password" option to verify typing

4. **Browser Troubleshooting:**
   - If persistent issues: "Let's try a different browser or clear your browser cache."
   - Fallback: Use incognito/private browsing mode

**Prevention:**
- Pre-session email reminding learners to verify GitHub login credentials
- Offer "office hours" before session for account setup assistance

---

### Issue 2: Learner's Device Has Connectivity Problems

**Symptoms:** "No internet connection," pages won't load, slow/intermittent connection

**Causes:**
- Wi-Fi connection dropped
- Incorrect Wi-Fi password
- Device Wi-Fi turned off
- Venue internet outage

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Verify Wi-Fi Connection:**
   - Check device Wi-Fi settings: "Is Wi-Fi turned on? Are you connected to [network name]?"
   - Reconnect to Wi-Fi network using password on whiteboard

2. **Switch to Mobile Hotspot:**
   - If venue Wi-Fi fails: "Let's connect you to my mobile hotspot instead." (Provide hotspot name and password)
   - Assist learner with connecting to hotspot

3. **Use Neighbor's Hotspot:**
   - Pair learner with neighbor who has working connection: "Can you share your screen with [Learner Name] for now?"

4. **Offline Workaround (Last Resort):**
   - If no connectivity possible: "Let's have you watch my demonstration closely and take notes. You can practice on your own later when you have internet."
   - Provide printed lab worksheet for offline review

**Prevention:**
- Test venue Wi-Fi 24 hours before session
- Bring fully charged mobile hotspot as backup
- Provide Wi-Fi network name and password on whiteboard before session starts

---

### Issue 3: Learner Is Confused or Overwhelmed (Cognitive Overload)

**Symptoms:** Learner stops participating, expresses frustration ("This is too hard"), stares blankly at screen, repeatedly asks same question

**Causes:**
- Content too complex for current skill level
- Pacing too fast
- Unclear instructions
- Technology anxiety

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Pause and Simplify:**
   - Stop group activity: "Let's pause for a moment. I want to make sure everyone's with me."
   - Break task into smaller micro-steps: "Forget everything else. Just focus on this one thing: clicking the 'Issues' tab."

2. **One-on-One Support:**
   - Sit with learner and provide individual guidance: "Let's go through this together, just you and me."
   - Use "I do, you watch; I do, you help; you do, I help; you do, I watch" progression

3. **Peer Assistance:**
   - Pair overwhelmed learner with advanced peer: "[Advanced Learner], can you help [Struggling Learner] through this task?"

4. **Reduce Scope:**
   - Simplify success criteria: "For today, let's just get you comfortable navigating to a repository. We'll work on creating issues next week."

5. **Normalize Struggle:**
   - Reassure learner: "This is hard. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed when learning something new. You're doing better than you think."
   - Share personal learning story: "When I first used GitHub, I spent 20 minutes trying to find the 'New Issue' button. We all struggle at first."

**Prevention:**
- Chunk content into smaller micro-topics (Cognitive Load Theory)
- Slow pacing; check for understanding frequently
- Provide visual job aids (cheat sheets) to reduce working memory load
- Celebrate small wins to build confidence

---

### Issue 4: Learner's Device Type Creates Interface Differences

**Symptoms:** Learner's screen looks different from instructor's demonstration (mobile vs. desktop interface)

**Causes:**
- Learner using phone/tablet vs. instructor using laptop
- GitHub mobile UI differs from desktop web UI

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Acknowledge Difference:**
   - "I see you're using a phone. The layout will look a bit different from my screen, but the functions are the same."

2. **Provide Mobile-Specific Guidance:**
   - "On mobile, the 'Issues' tab is in the menu icon at the top left. Tap that, then tap 'Issues.'"
   - Walk learner through mobile-specific navigation steps

3. **Pair with Desktop User:**
   - If mobile interface creates significant barriers: "Let's have you pair with [Learner Name] who's using a laptop. You can follow along on their screen and try on your phone later."

4. **Offer Desktop Alternative:**
   - If learner has laptop but chose mobile: "Would it be easier to switch to your laptop for this session? You can always use your phone later once you know how it works."

**Prevention:**
- Test all materials on multiple device types (laptop, tablet, phone) before session
- Prepare mobile-specific job aids if significant portion of learners use phones
- Recommend laptop use for training sessions in pre-session communication

---

### Issue 5: Learner Missed Previous Session and Is Behind

**Symptoms:** Learner unfamiliar with concepts assumed as prior knowledge (e.g., doesn't know what a repository is in Session 3)

**Causes:**
- Attendance gap due to farm emergency or seasonal conflict
- Didn't complete makeup work

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Quick Catch-Up:**
   - Provide 2-3 minute recap of missed session: "Last week we learned about repositories. A repository is like a digital file cabinet for your project."
   - Offer quick-reference guide from missed session

2. **Peer Mentor Assignment:**
   - Pair learner with advanced peer: "[Advanced Learner], can you help [Returning Learner] with the basics from last week while others work independently?"

3. **Offline Makeup Option:**
   - "I recorded a video walkthrough of last week's session. Can you watch that this week and come with questions next time?"
   - Provide video link or USB drive with recording

4. **Adjust Expectations:**
   - Reduce scope for this session: "Don't worry about mastering everything today. Focus on the core task, and we'll fill in gaps next week."

**Prevention:**
- Record all sessions for asynchronous makeup work
- Send recap emails after each session with key takeaways
- Offer "office hours" before sessions for catch-up support

---

## Emergency Procedures

**Purpose:** Protocols for handling unforeseen disruptions to training delivery

---

### Emergency 1: Instructor Illness or Unavailability

**Scenario:** Instructor cannot deliver session due to illness, family emergency, or other unforeseen event

**Response Timeline:** As soon as known (ideally 24+ hours before session)

**Steps:**

1. **Notify Learners Immediately:**
   - Send email/text/call all enrolled learners: "Due to [reason], today's session is postponed. We'll reschedule for [new date/time]."
   - Apologize for inconvenience and provide clear rescheduling plan

2. **Reschedule Session:**
   - Consult learners on availability for makeup date (send poll if needed)
   - Avoid rescheduling during planting/harvest blackout periods
   - Confirm new date via email/text

3. **Provide Asynchronous Resources (if rescheduling delayed):**
   - "While we reschedule, here's a video walkthrough of today's planned topic. Watch at your own pace and come with questions next time."
   - Distribute reading materials or quick-reference guides

4. **Identify Backup Facilitator (if available):**
   - If train-the-trainer candidate or agricultural extension educator is available: "Can you deliver this session using my materials?"
   - Provide facilitator guide and all session materials to backup

**Prevention:**
- Develop comprehensive facilitator guides so backup instructor can step in
- Record all sessions so learners can continue asynchronously if needed
- Build buffer time in schedule to absorb 1-2 session postponements without delaying overall timeline

---

### Emergency 2: Technology Failure (Venue Internet Outage, Projector Failure)

**Scenario:** Critical technology fails during session and cannot be quickly resolved

**Response Timeline:** Immediate

**Steps:**

1. **Assess Severity:**
   - **Minor (projector fails):** Adapt to non-projected delivery (learners follow on own devices, instructor demonstrates on learners' screens)
   - **Major (internet outage affecting all learners):** Pause session and pivot to offline activity

2. **Immediate Workaround:**
   - **Projector failure:** "Let's gather around one laptop so you can see my demonstration up close." OR "Pair up and follow along on one device between two people."
   - **Internet outage:** "We can't access GitHub right now, but let's use this time for a hands-on discussion. I'll show you screenshots and we'll talk through the process. You'll practice later when you have internet."

3. **Offline Activity (if needed):**
   - Conduct whiteboard walkthrough of concepts
   - Use printed screenshots to simulate GitHub interface
   - Focus on conceptual understanding and planning: "Let's map out what issues you'd create for your farm on paper."

4. **Makeup Practical Work:**
   - "Since we couldn't practice today, here's what I want you to do at home this week: [practice task]. We'll review your work together next session."

5. **Post-Session Follow-Up:**
   - Send video walkthrough and detailed instructions for completing practice task independently
   - Offer virtual office hours for troubleshooting

**Prevention:**
- Always bring backup mobile hotspot
- Test all equipment 60 minutes before session
- Prepare offline backup activities (printed materials, discussion prompts) for every session

### Emergency 3: Weather Cancellation or Farm Emergency

**Scenario:** Severe weather or agricultural emergency (e.g., livestock crisis, equipment failure during critical season) prevents learners from attending

**Response Timeline:** As soon as known

**Steps:**

1. **Cancel Session Proactively:**
   - If weather/emergency is known in advance: "Due to [weather/emergency], today's session is canceled for your safety. We'll reschedule."

2. **Provide Asynchronous Alternatives:**
   - "I know farm emergencies take priority. Here's a video of today's planned session. Watch when you can, and we'll catch up next time."
   - Send quick-reference guide and reading materials via email

3. **Reschedule Flexibly:**
   - Poll learners on new date: "What day/time works for everyone in the next 2 weeks?"
   - Accept that some sessions may need to be delayed during peak farm seasons

4. **Offer One-on-One Makeup:**
   - For learners who missed due to individual emergency: "I'm offering 30-minute one-on-one catch-up sessions this week. Let me know what time works for you."

**Prevention:**
- Build buffer time in schedule (14-16 weeks for 12 sessions allows for 2-4 cancellations)
- Plan sessions outside of planting/harvest blackout periods (May-June, Sept-Oct)
- Maintain asynchronous video library for all sessions

---

### Emergency 4: Learner Experiences Distress or Medical Issue

**Scenario:** Learner becomes ill, injured, or emotionally distressed during session

**Response Timeline:** Immediate

**Steps:**

1. **Ensure Learner Safety:**
   - Pause session: "Let's take a quick break."
   - Check on learner privately: "Are you okay? Do you need anything?"

2. **Provide Appropriate Support:**
   - **Minor (fatigue, headache):** Offer break, water, quiet space to rest
   - **Medical emergency:** Call 911 if needed; do not attempt to provide medical care beyond basic first aid
   - **Emotional distress:** Listen empathetically, offer to continue session another time, provide resources if appropriate

3. **Resume or Reschedule:**
   - If learner recovers quickly: "Take your time. Rejoin us when you're ready."
   - If learner needs to leave: "No problem. I'll send you the materials and we can catch up later. Take care of yourself."

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - Check in with learner within 24 hours: "How are you feeling? Can I help you make up what you missed?"

**Prevention:**
- Schedule regular breaks (every 45-60 minutes)
- Provide snacks and water
- Encourage learners to speak up if they need a break

---

## Seasonal Break Procedures

**Purpose:** Maintain learner engagement and knowledge retention during planting/harvest season breaks

**Typical Breaks:**
- **Planting Season (May-June):** 6-8 weeks
- **Harvest Season (Sept-Oct):** 6-8 weeks

---

### Pre-Break Preparation (1 week before break)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Announce Break Clearly:**
  - "We'll take a break for planting season. Our next session will be [date], about 6 weeks from now."
  - Explain rationale: "I know you'll be swamped with farm work, so we're pausing to give you time."

- [ ] **Recap Session:**
  - Conduct brief recap of all sessions completed so far (15-20 minutes)
  - "Let's review what we've learned: Repositories, Issues, Projects. Anyone want to share how they've been using GitHub?"

- [ ] **Distribute Recap Materials:**
  - Provide consolidated quick-reference guide covering all topics to date
  - "Keep this handy during the break. Use GitHub when you can, even if just to track one or two tasks."

- [ ] **Encourage Continued Practice:**
  - "GitHub works best when you use it regularly. Try to create at least one issue or update one project board during the break."

- [ ] **Provide Asynchronous Resources:**
  - "If you forget something, here are videos of all our sessions so far: [links]."
  - "Email or text me anytime with questions during the break. I'm here to help."

---

### During Break (Ongoing)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Mid-Break Check-In (Week 3-4):**
  - Send email or text: "Hope planting season is going well! Just a quick reminder that GitHub is there if you need to track tasks. How's it going?"
  - Offer virtual office hours: "I'm available for 15-minute video calls if you want help with anything."

- [ ] **Share Success Stories (if available):**
  - If learners are using GitHub during break, share anonymized examples: "One farmer used GitHub to track irrigation schedules during planting. Great idea!"

- [ ] **Maintain Engagement (Low-Pressure):**
  - Send occasional tips: "Quick tip: You can access GitHub from your phone while you're out in the field. Just bookmark github.com on your mobile browser."

---

### Post-Break Re-Engagement (1 week before resuming)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Announce Return Date:**
  - Send reminder email/text: "Welcome back! Our next GitHub session is [date/time]. Looking forward to seeing you."

- [ ] **Preview Next Session:**
  - "We'll start with a quick refresher on what we learned before the break, then dive into [next topic]."

- [ ] **Invite Questions:**
  - "If you tried using GitHub during the break and ran into issues, bring those questions to the session. We'll troubleshoot together."

- [ ] **Plan Refresher Activity:**
  - First 15 minutes of post-break session: Hands-on refresher exercise reviewing core skills (navigate repo, create issue, update project)
  - "Let's shake off the rust together. Everyone, create a quick issue for a task on your farm this week."

## Accessibility Accommodation Procedures

**Purpose:** Ensure inclusive learning environment compliant with ADA/Section 508/WCAG 2.2 Level AA

---

### Pre-Session: Identify Accommodation Needs

**Tasks:**

1. **Send Accessibility Survey (with enrollment or 2 weeks before Session 1):**

   > "To ensure the training works for everyone, please let me know if you need any accommodations:
   > - Do you use a screen reader or other assistive technology?
   > - Do you need materials in large print?
   > - Do you require closed captions on videos?
   > - Do you need additional time for hands-on exercises?
   > - Do you have mobility needs (wheelchair access, accessible seating)?
   > - Is there anything else I should know to make the training accessible for you?"

2. **Follow Up Individually:**
   - Call or meet with learners who request accommodations to clarify needs and plan solutions
   - Document accommodation plan in learner notes

---

### Common Accommodations & Implementations

| Accommodation | Implementation |

- [ ] Check in with learner privately during break: "Is everything working for you? Do you need any adjustments?"
- [ ] Adjust pacing if needed for extended-time accommodations
- [ ] Ensure all verbal instructions are also written on slides or handouts

---

### Post-Session: Evaluate Effectiveness

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Ask learner: "Did the accommodations work for you? Is there anything I should change for next session?"
- [ ] Document what worked and what needs adjustment in accessibility notes
- [ ] Iterate materials based on feedback (SAM methodology applied to accessibility)

---

## Facilitator Tips

**Purpose:** General best practices for effective, inclusive session delivery

---

### 1. Start with "Why" (Andragogy: Need to Know)

Every session, every activity, every new concept must answer: "Why does this matter for my farm?"

**Examples:**
- **Session 1 (Repositories):** "A repository is like a digital barn for your farm project. It keeps everything organized in one place so you never lose important records."
- **Session 3 (Project Boards):** "Project boards prevent you from missing critical tasks like re-seeding a field or scheduling equipment maintenance."

---

### 2. Use Agricultural Analogies

Connect GitHub concepts to farming practices learners already understand.

**Examples:**
- **Commit = planting record:** "A commit is like writing down what you planted in which field on which date. You're creating a permanent record."
- **Issue = ear tag for tasks:** "Issues are like ear tags for your to-do list. Each task has an ID and details you can track."
- **Branch = trying a new seed variety:** "Branches let you experiment without messing up your main project, like testing a new crop variety in a small plot before planting your whole field."

---

### 3. Normalize Mistakes

Technology anxiety is real. Make mistakes safe.

**What to Say:**
- "Making mistakes is how you learn. I make GitHub mistakes all the time."
- "If you click the wrong button, it's not the end of the world. We can undo it."
- "There's no such thing as a dumb question. If you're confused, ask."

**What to Do:**
- Celebrate mistakes as learning moments: "Great question! You found something confusing that I need to explain better."
- Share your own mistakes during demonstrations: "Oops, I just clicked 'Delete' by accident. Let me show you how to fix that."

---

### 4. "I Do, We Do, You Do" Progression (Agricultural Extension Model)

Never skip stages. Learners need scaffolding.

**Progression:**
1. **I Do (Instructor Demonstration):** "Watch me create an issue. I'll narrate every step."
2. **We Do Together (Guided Practice):** "Now let's all create an issue together. I'll walk you through step-by-step."
3. **You Do (Independent Practice):** "Now try creating an issue for your own farm task. I'll be here if you need help."

---

### 5. Check for Understanding Frequently

Don't assume silence = understanding.

**Techniques:**
- **Thumbs up/sideways/down:** "Thumbs up if you're following, sideways if you're confused, down if you're lost."
- **Turn and talk:** "Turn to your neighbor and explain what we just did in your own words."
- **Show me:** "Everyone, show me your screen. I want to see that you're on the 'Issues' tab."

---

### 6. Slow Down

You know GitHub. Learners don't. What seems simple to you is brand new to them.

**Practices:**
- Pause 3-5 seconds after each step during demonstrations
- Repeat important instructions 2-3 times
- Wait for 100% of learners to reach each checkpoint before moving on
- If 3+ learners are struggling, STOP and re-teach

---

### 7. Celebrate Small Wins

Confidence builds through success. Acknowledge progress.

**What to Say:**
- "You just created your first GitHub issue! That's a big deal."
- "Look at that—you're navigating GitHub like a pro already."
- "I'm impressed by how quickly you picked that up."

---

### 8. Build Community (Agricultural Extension: Peer Learning)

Farmers trust farmers. Foster peer relationships.

**Strategies:**
- Pair advanced learners with novices during practice
- Create "show and tell" moments: "Who wants to share what they created?"
- Encourage peer troubleshooting: "Before you raise your hand for me, ask your neighbor for help."
- Share success stories: "Last week, [Learner Name] used GitHub to track their equipment maintenance. Great idea!"

---

### 9. Respect Learner Experience (Andragogy)

Farmers are experts in farming. Honor their knowledge.

**Practices:**
- Ask for their input: "How would you use GitHub for [farming task]?"
- Connect to their expertise: "You already track livestock health. GitHub does the same thing digitally."
- Avoid condescension: Never say "It's easy" or "Everyone knows this."

---

### 10. Be Patient with Technology Anxiety

Some learners genuinely believe "I'm not good with technology." This is a mindset, not a fact.

**Strategies:**
- Reframe: "You're not 'bad with technology'—you just haven't had good training yet. That's what we're fixing."
- Provide frequent encouragement: "You're doing better than you think."
- Adjust expectations: "By the end of this curriculum, you won't be a GitHub expert—but you'll be confident enough to use it for your farm. That's the goal."
