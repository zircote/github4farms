- **Option A: Crop Farming** — Focus on the `crops/` folder
- **Option B: Livestock** — Focus on the `livestock/` folder
- **Option C: Equipment & Maintenance** — Focus on the `equipment/` folder

## Stretch Challenge (If You Finish Early)

- Explore a folder you didn't choose (try all three!)
- Count the total number of files in the entire repository
- Find the oldest file in the repository (hint: look at the dates next to file names)
- Look at the "commits" count at the top of the repository — what do you think that number means?

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find the repository | Check the URL — make sure you typed it exactly. Ask your partner to show you theirs. |
| Page looks different from the slides | GitHub occasionally updates its design. The content is the same — look for the file list and README. |
| Clicked something and got lost | Click the repository name at the very top of the page. It always takes you back to the main page. |
| Text is too small to read | Press Ctrl/Cmd and + to zoom in. Press Ctrl/Cmd and - to zoom out. |
| Browser is not loading | Check your Wi-Fi connection. Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl/Cmd + R). |
