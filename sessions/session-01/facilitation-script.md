# Facilitation Script — Session 1: Introduction to GitHub & Repositories

> **Total Duration:** 150 minutes
> **Learners:** 1–25 farmers with no technical background
> **Setup Required:** Projector, Wi-Fi, loaner laptops if needed, printed lab exercises and cheat sheets
> **Key Goal:** Every learner leaves having successfully navigated a repository and created a GitHub account. No one fails Session 1.

---

## Pre-Session Setup (30 minutes before)

- [ ] Arrive 30 minutes early
- [ ] Test projector — confirm text is readable from the back row
- [ ] Test Wi-Fi — connect a device and load github.com
- [ ] Set up backup mobile hotspot
- [ ] Arrange tables for pair work (2 per table, power outlets accessible)
- [ ] Place at each seat: printed lab exercise, cheat sheet, feedback survey, pen
- [ ] Open demo farm repository on projector browser
- [ ] Have sign-in sheet at the door
- [ ] Write Wi-Fi password on whiteboard (large text)

---

## Phase 1: Welcome & Hook (0:00 – 0:10)

### Script

> "Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our first GitHub training session. My name is [Name], and I'm excited to be here with you.
>
> Before we touch any computers, I want to ask you a question. Raise your hand if this sounds familiar:
>
> You need to find a document — maybe a planting schedule, a maintenance record, or a receipt — and you can't remember where you put it. Is it in the filing cabinet? On your phone? In that stack on the kitchen counter?
>
> [Pause. Let hands go up. Smile.]
>
> That's the problem we're going to start solving today.
>
> Today, you're going to learn about a free website called GitHub that gives your farm a single, organized, always-accessible home for your information. Think of it as a **digital barn** — everything in one place, organized into sections, accessible from any device.
>
> By the end of today, you will have:
> 1. Explored a real farm repository on GitHub
> 2. Created your own GitHub account
>
> That's it. Two things. And I promise — you cannot break anything. There is no wrong button to click."

### Timing Notes
- Spend a full minute on the "raise your hand" moment — let it land
- If learners seem tense, add: "I was nervous about technology too when I first started. That's completely normal."

---

## Phase 2: Instructor Demo (0:10 – 0:25)

### Script

> "I'm going to show you GitHub on the big screen. For now, just watch — don't follow along on your computers yet. Just watch and listen."

**[Open github.com on projector]**

> "This is GitHub's website. Over 40 million people use it. It was originally built for software developers, but now all kinds of people use it — researchers, writers, teachers, and today — farmers."

**[Navigate to demo farm repository]**

> "This is a **repository**. Think of it as a digital barn. See the name at the top? That's the name of this barn.
>
> Below that, you see a list of files and folders. These are like items organized on shelves.
>
> And this text below? This is the **README**. It's like the sign on the barn door — it tells you what's inside."

**[Click on the `crops/` folder]**

> "I'm clicking this folder called 'crops.' See how it opened and showed me the files inside? Just like opening a section of the barn.
>
> Now I'll click on this file — 'planting-schedule.md'"

**[Click the file, let it load]**

> "And there's the planting schedule. I can read it right here in my browser. No download, no special software.
>
> To go back, I click the repository name at the top. Watch..."

**[Click back. Pause.]**

> "That's it. That's navigating a repository. Click a folder, click a file, click the name to go back. Three actions."

### Key Points
- Narrate every single click: "I'm clicking here... now I see this..."
- Pause after each action for 5 seconds
- Point at the screen with your hand to direct attention
- Common mistake to mention: "Some people try to use the browser's back button — that works too, but clicking the repository name is more reliable."

---

## Phase 3: Guided Practice (0:25 – 0:45)

### Script

> "Now it's your turn! Open your laptop and follow along with me.
>
> First — let's make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi. The password is on the whiteboard. Raise your hand if you need help connecting."

**[Wait. Circulate. Help anyone struggling with Wi-Fi. This may take 5 minutes.]**

> "Great. Now open your browser — that's Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge. It's the app you use to go to websites.
>
> In the address bar at the top, type: **[demo repository URL]**
>
> [Spell it out slowly. Display it on the projector in large text.]
>
> Raise your hand when you see the repository page."

**[Wait until 80% of hands are up. Help the rest.]**

> "Now, find the README text. It should be below the list of files. What does it say this repository is for?
>
> Turn to your partner and tell each other what you see."

**[Give 1 minute for pair discussion.]**

> "Now click the `crops/` folder. You should see a list of files inside.
>
> Find the file called `planting-schedule.md` and click it.
>
> **Checkpoint:** Raise your hand when you see a table with crop names and dates."

**[Wait. Circulate. This is the most important checkpoint — everyone must reach it.]**

> "Excellent! You just navigated a GitHub repository. You found a folder, opened a file, and read real farm data. That's a real skill."

### Troubleshooting During Guided Practice

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "I can't find the address bar" | "It's the long bar at the very top of the browser window. Click in it and start typing." |
| "The page doesn't load" | Check Wi-Fi. Try refreshing (Ctrl/Cmd + R). Switch to backup hotspot if needed. |
| "It looks different from yours" | "GitHub sometimes looks slightly different on different browsers. Look for the file list and the README text." |
| "I accidentally went somewhere else" | "No problem! Click the address bar and type the URL again. Or press Ctrl/Cmd + Z to go back." |
| Learner is frozen, not clicking anything | Sit next to them. "Let's do this together. Click right here." Guide their hand if they're comfortable. |

## Phase 4: Concept Explanation & Discussion (0:45 – 1:10)

### Script

> "You just explored a repository. Let's talk about what you saw and why it matters.
>
> A **repository** is like a digital barn. Everything your farm needs in one place.
>
> The **README** is like the sign on the barn door. It tells anyone who visits what they'll find.
>
> **Files** are the actual items — your schedules, records, logs.
>
> **Folders** keep everything organized — just like having different sections in your barn for crops, equipment, and livestock."

**[Show Slide 8 — Repository Anatomy table]**

> "Here's the thing that makes GitHub different from just a folder on your computer: **history**.
>
> Every time someone adds or changes a file on GitHub, it records exactly what changed, who changed it, and when. It's like having an automatic logbook.
>
> Think about that for a moment. If someone updates the planting schedule, you can see the old version and the new version. You can see who made the change and when. Nothing gets lost."

**Discussion prompt:**

> "Turn to your partner and answer this: What's one type of information from your farm that you'd want to keep in a repository? You have 2 minutes."

**[2 minutes. Then ask 2-3 volunteers to share.]**

> "Great answers. [Respond to each specifically.] Those are exactly the kinds of things GitHub was built to organize."

**Vocabulary review:**

> "Before our break, let's review the four terms we've learned. Don't worry about memorizing them — you have the cheat sheet!
>
> [Hold up cheat sheet]
>
> - Repository = digital barn
> - README = sign on the barn door
> - File = item on a shelf
> - Folder = stall or section
>
> That's only 4 new terms for today. We keep it manageable."

---

## BREAK (1:10 – 1:25)

### Script

> "Let's take a 15-minute break. Stretch, grab a drink, use the restroom. I'll be here if you have any questions.
>
> We'll start back at [time] — please be back in your seats by then."

### During Break
- [ ] Circulate to help anyone who fell behind
- [ ] Check: did anyone not reach the guided practice checkpoint?
- [ ] Note any widespread confusion for post-break mention
- [ ] Verify all devices still have Wi-Fi

---

## Phase 5: Account Creation (1:25 – 1:50)

### Script

> "Welcome back! For the next part, we're going to create your own GitHub account. This is YOUR account — you'll use it for the rest of the training and beyond.
>
> You'll need:
> - An email address you can check right now
> - A password — I recommend writing it down somewhere safe
>
> Let's do this together, step by step."

**[Project github.com/signup on screen]**

> "Step 1: Go to github.com in your browser.
> Step 2: Click the big 'Sign up' button in the top right.
> Step 3: Enter your email address. [Pause. Let everyone type.]
> Step 4: Create a password. It needs to be at least 8 characters. Write it down!
> Step 5: Choose a username. This can be your name, your farm name, or a nickname. It has to be unique on GitHub.
> Step 6: There's a little puzzle to verify you're a real person. Just follow the instructions on screen.
> Step 7: Check your email for a verification code. Enter it when prompted."

**[Go very slowly. This will take 10-15 minutes. Circulate constantly.]**

> "**Checkpoint:** Raise your hand when you see your GitHub dashboard — it should say 'Welcome to GitHub' or show a home page with suggestions."

### Common Issues

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "My email is already registered" | "Great — that means you already have an account! Try logging in instead. Do you remember your password?" |
| "I can't think of a username" | "Try your first name and farm name, like 'maria-sunrise-farm' or 'john_smith_ag'" |
| "The verification puzzle is confusing" | Sit with them and help. These vary — some are image selection, some are drag puzzles. |
| "I didn't get the verification email" | "Check your spam/junk folder. If it's not there, click 'Resend email' on the GitHub page." |
| "I don't have an email address" | Help them create a free Gmail account first (have this as a backup plan). |

---

## Phase 6: Independent Practice (1:50 – 2:00 + ongoing)

### Script

> "Now that you have your own account, let's practice what you learned. Pick up the lab exercise sheet on your table.
>
> You have about 30 minutes to work through it at your own pace. Choose the farm scenario that interests you: crop farming, livestock, or equipment.
>
> Remember:
> - If you get stuck, ask your partner first
> - If you're both stuck, raise your hand
> - There are no wrong answers
> - The stretch challenges at the end are optional bonus activities"

**[Circulate continuously during this time. Note who finishes quickly (potential train-the-trainer candidates) and who struggles (may need extra support).]**

### L2 Assessment Notes

While circulating, observe and note:

| Learner | Can navigate to repo? | Can open folder? | Can read file? | Can navigate back? | Created account? | Notes |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |

---

## Phase 7: Reflection (2:00 – 2:10)

### Script

> "Let's wrap up the practice. Even if you didn't finish everything, that's completely fine.
>
> I want you to think about two things:
> 1. What's one thing you learned today?
> 2. What's one farm task you could see putting into a GitHub repository?
>
> Turn to your partner and share. You have 2 minutes."

**[2 minutes. Then open to volunteers.]**

> "Who'd like to share? [Name], what did you come up with?"

**[Respond specifically and positively to each share:]**
- "That's a great example — maintenance records are perfect for this."
- "I love that idea — tracking irrigation inspections is exactly what we'll learn to do in Session 2."

> "I want to celebrate something. Today, every single one of you navigated a GitHub repository and created your own account. That's real. You did that."

---

## Phase 8: Wrap-Up (2:10 – 2:20)

### Script

> "Here's what we covered today:
> 1. GitHub is a free website for organizing information — your digital barn
> 2. A repository holds your files, folders, and history
> 3. The README explains what's inside
> 4. You can navigate files and folders by clicking
>
> Next session — **Session 2** — you'll learn about Issues. Issues are GitHub's version of work orders. You'll create digital tasks for farm work and track them to completion.
>
> **Between now and then, here's an optional challenge:**
> - Log into GitHub from your phone
> - Visit the farm repository we explored today
> - Think of 3 farm tasks you'd want to track digitally
>
> Now please fill out the feedback survey on your table. It takes about 2 minutes and your honest feedback helps me improve.
>
> **Thank you for being here today. See you at Session 2!**"

---

## Phase 9: Buffer (2:20 – 2:30)

- [ ] Collect feedback surveys
- [ ] Help any learner who didn't complete the exercise
- [ ] Answer remaining questions one-on-one
- [ ] Record final attendance count
- [ ] Note learners who may need extra support next session
- [ ] Note fast finishers as potential train-the-trainer candidates

---

## Post-Session (within 24 hours)

- [ ] Write debrief: `delivery/session-01-debrief.md`
  - Attendance count
  - What worked well
  - What to adjust
  - Timing accuracy (was any phase too long/short?)
  - Learners who struggled
  - Learners who excelled
- [ ] Enter L1 feedback survey data
- [ ] Record L2 assessment observations
- [ ] Adjust Session 2 materials if needed based on today

## Emergency Procedures

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Wi-Fi goes down | Switch to backup hotspot. If no internet, pivot to offline demo using screenshots. |
| Projector fails | Gather learners around a single laptop. Or switch to verbal walkthrough with printed screenshots. |
| Learner becomes frustrated | Sit with them privately. "Let's take a breath. We can go at your pace." Offer to help one-on-one during break. |
| Power outage | End session early. Reschedule. Distribute printed cheat sheets for at-home reading. |
| Learner has no email | Help create a free Gmail account (5 minutes). Have this backup plan ready. |
| GitHub is down (rare) | Use cached screenshots of the demo repository. Focus on vocabulary and discussion. Reschedule hands-on portions. |
