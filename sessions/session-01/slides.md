### Slide 1 — Title

**Introduction to GitHub & Repositories**
*Your Digital Barn for Farm Information*

Session 1 of 12 — GitHub Training for Farmers

[Date] | [Location]

---

### Slide 2 — Welcome

**Welcome!**

Today's goal: By the end of this session, you will have explored a real GitHub repository and know how to find information stored inside it.

No coding. No technical background needed. Just curiosity.

> Instructor note: Greet each learner by name if possible. Set a relaxed, friendly tone.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

Where do you keep your farm's important information right now?

- Filing cabinet?
- Notebook?
- Your phone?
- Your head?

*What happens when you can't find something?*

> Instructor note: Ask this question out loud. Let 2-3 learners answer. Validate every response.

---

### Slide 4 — The Problem We're Solving

**Farm information is scattered**

- Paper gets lost or damaged
- Files live on one computer
- Knowledge is in one person's head
- No record of what changed and when

**GitHub gives your farm a single, organized, always-accessible home for information.**

---

### Slide 5 — What Is GitHub?

**GitHub is a website where you store, organize, and share information.**

Think of it as a **digital barn** for your farm:
- Everything in one place
- Organized into sections
- Accessible from any device
- You can always see what changed and when

It's free. It works on any device with a browser. And your information can be **private** — only people you invite can see it.

> Instructor note: Emphasize "website" — not software to install. Mention privacy early to reduce anxiety. Open github.com on the projector.

---

### Slide 6 — Who Uses GitHub?

**Farmers, teachers, researchers, and writers all use GitHub.**

Originally built for software developers, but now used by all kinds of people:
- Researchers documenting experiments
- Writers collaborating on books
- Teachers sharing lesson plans
- Governments publishing public data
- **And now — farmers managing farm operations!**

Over 40 million people use it — and you're joining them.

---

### Slide 7 — What Is a Repository?

**Repository = Your Digital Barn**

A repository (or "repo") is a container that holds:
- **Files** — documents, spreadsheets, photos, plans
- **Folders** — organized sections for different topics
- **History** — a record of every change ever made

Just like a barn holds your tools, supplies, and records — a repository holds your farm's digital information.

---

### Slide 8 — Repository Anatomy

**Inside a Repository:**

| Part | Farm Analogy | What It Does |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| README | Sign on the barn door | Explains what's inside |
| Files | Items on shelves | Your actual documents and data |
| Folders | Stalls and sections | Organization by category |
| History | Logbook | Record of every change |

> Instructor note: Point to each element on the projected GitHub repository page.

---

### Slide 9 — The README File

**The README is the welcome sign for your repository.**

It's the first thing anyone sees. A good README answers:
- What is this repository for?
- What's inside?
- How do I use it?

Think of it as the sign on your barn door that tells visitors what they'll find inside.

---

### Slide 10 — Live Demo: A Farm Repository

**Let's look at a real repository together.**

> Instructor note: Open the demo farm repository (zircote/github4farms-training) on the projector. Walk through each element slowly.

I'm going to show you:
1. The repository name and description
2. The README file
3. The file list and folders
4. How to open and read a file

**Just watch for now — you'll try it yourself in a few minutes.**

---

### Slide 11 — Navigating the Interface

**Key areas of the GitHub page:**

1. **Top bar** — search, notifications, your profile
2. **Repository name** — at the top of the page
3. **File list** — the main area showing files and folders
4. **README** — displayed below the file list
5. **About section** — description on the right side

> Instructor note: Point to each area on the projected screen. Pause after each. "Does everyone see where I'm pointing?"

---

### Slide 12 — Opening a File

**To read a file, click its name.**

That's it. One click.

The file opens and you can read it right in your browser. No download needed.

To go back to the file list, click the repository name at the top.

> Instructor note: Demonstrate clicking a file, reading it, and clicking back. Do this 2-3 times.

---

### Slide 13 — Folders

**Folders organize your files into categories.**

Click a folder name to see what's inside. Just like opening a section of your barn.

Common farm repository folders:
- `crops/` — planting schedules, crop records
- `equipment/` — maintenance logs, manuals
- `livestock/` — health records, feeding schedules
- `compliance/` — grant documents, certifications

---

### Slide 14 — Guided Practice Introduction

**Now it's your turn!**

You and your partner will explore the sample farm repository together.

I'll walk you through each step. Follow along on your screen.

If you get stuck:
1. Ask your partner
2. Raise your hand — I'll come to you

**There is no wrong way to click. You cannot break anything.**

> Instructor note: Pair learners. Distribute the lab exercise handout.

---

### Slide 15 — Guided Practice Steps

**Follow along with me:**

1. Open your browser (Chrome, Safari, or Firefox)
2. Go to: **[demo repository URL]**
3. Find the README — what does it say this repository is for?
4. Find the `crops/` folder — click to open it
5. Find the file called `planting-schedule.md` — click to read it

**Checkpoint:** You should see a table with crop names and dates.

> Instructor note: Walk through each step on projector. Pause at checkpoint. "Raise your hand when you see the table."

---

### Slide 16 — Understanding What You See

**Let's talk about what you just did.**

You:
- Navigated to a GitHub repository
- Read the README to understand its purpose
- Found a folder and opened it
- Read a file with real farm data

That's the foundation of everything we'll learn. Every future session builds on these skills.

---

### Slide 17 — Key Vocabulary So Far

| GitHub Term | Farm Analogy | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Repository | Barn | Container for all your farm's files |
| README | Barn door sign | Explains what's inside |
| File | Item on a shelf | A single document or record |
| Folder | Stall or section | Organizes files by category |

**Don't memorize these — you'll get a cheat sheet to take home!**

---

### Slide 18 — BREAK (15 Minutes)

**Take 15 minutes.**

- Stretch, grab a drink
- Ask me any questions
- Help your partner if they need it

We'll start back at [time].

---

### Slide 19 — Creating Your GitHub Account

**Let's set up your own GitHub account.**

You'll need:
- An email address
- A password (write it down somewhere safe!)

I'll walk you through every step.

> Instructor note: Project github.com/signup and walk through each field. Go very slowly. Common issues: email already registered, password requirements, CAPTCHA.

---

### Slide 20 — Account Creation Steps

1. Go to **github.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"** (top right)
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password (8+ characters)
5. Choose a username (your name or farm name works great)
6. Complete the verification puzzle
7. Check your email for the verification code
8. Enter the code

**Checkpoint:** You should see your GitHub dashboard.

> Instructor note: Have learners do this while you project each step. Allow 10+ minutes. Help individuals as needed.

---

### Slide 21 — Customize Your Profile

**Make GitHub feel like yours.**

1. Click your profile icon (top right)
2. Click **"Your profile"**
3. Click **"Edit profile"**
4. Add your name (or farm name)
5. Optionally add a photo

This is your GitHub identity. Other farmers in this group will see your name when you collaborate.

---

### Slide 22 — Independent Practice Introduction

**Your challenge: Explore the farm repository on your own.**

You'll have 30 minutes to complete the lab exercise.

The exercise asks you to find specific files and answer questions about what you see.

Pick the farm scenario that interests you most:
- **Option A:** Crop farming
- **Option B:** Livestock
- **Option C:** Equipment & maintenance

---

### Slide 23 — Reflection

**Before we wrap up, think about this:**

- What's one thing you learned today that surprised you?
- What's one farm task you could see organizing in a GitHub repository?

Turn to your partner and share your answers. (2 minutes)

> Instructor note: Give 2 minutes. Then ask for 2-3 volunteers to share with the group. Celebrate every answer.

---

### Slide 24 — What's Next

**Session 2: GitHub Issues for Task Tracking**

Next time, you'll learn to create "Issues" — GitHub's version of work orders. You'll create digital tasks for real farm work and track them to completion.

**Between now and then (optional):**
- Log into your GitHub account from your phone
- Look at the farm repository we explored today
- Think of 3 farm tasks you'd want to track digitally

---

### Slide 25 — Feedback Survey

**Please fill out this 2-minute survey before you leave.**

Your feedback helps me make this training better for you.

[Distribute paper survey or share digital link]

**Thank you for coming today. You just took your first step into GitHub!**

> Instructor note: Collect surveys. Note attendance. Stay for 10 minutes to help anyone with questions.
