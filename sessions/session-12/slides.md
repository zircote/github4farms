### Slide 1 --- Title

**Capstone & Train-the-Trainer**
*Putting It All Together and Teaching Others*

Session 12 of 12 --- GitHub Training for Farmers

---

### Slide 2 --- Welcome to the Final Session

**Congratulations --- You Made It!**

Twelve sessions ago, many of you had never heard of GitHub. Today, you're about to build a complete farm management system on the platform --- and teach someone else how to use it.

This session has two parts:
1. **Capstone Project** --- Build a complete farm repository using every skill you've learned
2. **Train-the-Trainer** --- Practice teaching a GitHub concept to a peer

Today is YOUR day. Less instruction from me, more creation from you.

---

### Slide 3 --- Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

What if you could set up a new farm management system from scratch --- on your own, without help?

- New growing season? Build a fresh project board with timelines.
- New employee or family member joining the farm? Teach them the system.
- Neighboring farmer asks how you stay organized? Show them.

*The real test of learning is doing it independently --- and then helping someone else do it too.*

> Instructor note: Ask 2-3 learners: "What's one thing you wish you'd had organized on GitHub at the start of this past season?" Use their answers to motivate the capstone.

---

### Slide 4 --- Your Learning Journey: Sessions 1-11

**Look how far you've come:**

| Session | What You Learned | Farm Analogy |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | GitHub navigation & repositories | Your digital farm office |
| 2 | Issues & task tracking | Work orders for the farm |
| 3 | Projects & organization | Your farm planning board |
| 4 | Pull Requests & collaboration | Reviewing a farmhand's work |
| 5 | Notifications & communication | The farm radio / bulletin board |
| 6 | Templates & standardization | Pre-printed work order forms |
| 7 | YAML & configuration basics | Writing recipes for automation |
| 8 | GitHub Actions & automation | The automated irrigation timer |
| 9 | Advanced Projects | The master farm calendar |
| 10 | GitHub Copilot | Your AI writing assistant |
| 11 | Spark & Copilot Agents | Your digital farmhand team |

**Today: You combine ALL of these into one complete system.**

---

### Slide 5 --- Capstone Project: The Big Picture

**Your challenge: Build a complete farm repository from scratch.**

Think of it as building a brand-new farm office. You need:
- The building (repository)
- The filing system (Issues and labels)
- The planning wall (Project board with views)
- The work order forms (Issue templates)
- The schedule (iterations and Timeline view)
- The AI helper (at least one Copilot-drafted Issue)

By the end, you'll have a working farm management system that you could use starting tomorrow.

---

### Slide 6 --- Capstone Requirements

**Your completed repository must include:**

- [ ] **Repository** with a descriptive name and README
- [ ] **At least 5 Issues** covering different farm tasks
- [ ] **Labels** (at least 4 custom labels relevant to your operation)
- [ ] **Issue template** (at least 1 template for recurring tasks)
- [ ] **Project board** linked to your repository
- [ ] **Custom fields** on your Project (at least 2: e.g., Priority, Season, Cost)
- [ ] **Iterations** set up (e.g., weekly or monthly sprints)
- [ ] **Timeline view** showing your Issues on a calendar
- [ ] **At least 1 Copilot-drafted Issue** (prompt, generate, evaluate, edit)
- [ ] **Board view** with columns organized by status or category

**This is your checklist. Keep it open as you work.**

---

### Slide 7 --- Choose Your Scenario

**Pick the scenario that matches your operation:**

**Option A: Diversified Crop Farm**
You're setting up a repository to manage a multi-crop operation across several fields. Think planting schedules, soil testing, harvest planning, equipment prep, and crop rotation.

**Option B: Equipment Fleet Management**
You're setting up a repository to track maintenance, inspections, repairs, and seasonal readiness for all your farm equipment. Think tractors, combines, trucks, implements, and shop supplies.

**Option C: Livestock Operation**
You're setting up a repository to manage animal health, feeding schedules, breeding records, veterinary visits, and facility maintenance. Think herds, flocks, pasture rotation, and regulatory compliance.

**Or create your own scenario** based on your actual farm.

---

### Slide 8 --- Capstone Rubric Overview

**How your capstone will be assessed:**

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Repository Setup** | Name, README, clear description | Name and README present | Repository created, minimal README | Repository exists |
| **Issues (5+)** | Detailed, labeled, well-written | Adequate detail, most labeled | Some Issues created, few labels | Fewer than 3 Issues |
| **Project Board** | Board + Timeline views, custom fields, iterations | Board view with some custom fields | Board created, default settings | No Project board |
| **Templates** | Template works and matches farm needs | Template created with most fields | Basic template exists | No template |
| **Copilot Use** | Drafted, evaluated, and edited with clear improvements | Drafted and edited | Drafted only, no edits | No Copilot use |
| **Overall Coherence** | All pieces work together as a real system | Most pieces connected | Pieces created but not integrated | Disconnected elements |

**Target score: 18+ out of 24**

> Instructor note: Distribute the printed rubric (from the lab exercise handout). Walk through one row to show how scoring works. Emphasize that "Excellent" means they used the skill the way they'd use it on their real farm.

---

### Slide 9 --- Getting Started: Your First 5 Minutes

**Step-by-step to launch your capstone:**

1. Go to **github.com** and click the **+** button > **New repository**
2. Name it something descriptive (e.g., `sunrise-acres-crop-plan`, `smith-ranch-equipment`, `hillside-livestock-mgmt`)
3. Check **"Add a README file"**
4. Click **"Create repository"**
5. Edit the README to describe your farm operation in 2-3 sentences

**You should be at this point within 5 minutes.** Then move to creating Issues.

Refer to your **Capstone Guide** handout for step-by-step details.

---

### Slide 10 --- Work Time Begins

**You have 50 minutes for capstone work.**

Use the checklist on Slide 6 (also on your handout) to track progress.

**Suggested order:**
1. Repository + README (5 min)
2. Create labels (5 min)
3. Create 5+ Issues, including 1 with Copilot (15 min)
4. Create an Issue template (5 min)
5. Set up Project board with custom fields (10 min)
6. Add iterations and Timeline view (10 min)

**If you get stuck:**
1. Check your Capstone Guide handout
2. Ask your table partner
3. Raise your hand

> Instructor note: Start a visible timer. Walk the room continuously. Use the L2 observation checklist to note skills demonstrated. Give 5-minute warnings at the 25-minute and 45-minute marks.

---

### Slide 11 --- Capstone Work Time (continued)

**Keep building!**

Progress check --- where should you be?

| Time Elapsed | You Should Have Completed |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 10 minutes | Repository, README, labels |
| 20 minutes | 3+ Issues created (including 1 Copilot-drafted) |
| 30 minutes | 5 Issues, Issue template created |
| 40 minutes | Project board with custom fields |
| 50 minutes | Iterations, Timeline view, final review |

**Remember: Done is better than perfect.** A working system you'll actually use beats a polished system you won't.

---

### Slide 12 --- BREAK (15 Minutes)

**Take 15 minutes.**

When we come back:
- You'll finish any remaining capstone work (10 min)
- Then we shift to the **Train-the-Trainer** exercise

**During the break, think about:** Which GitHub skill are you most confident teaching to someone else?

---

### Slide 13 --- Final Capstone Work Time

**10 more minutes to polish your capstone.**

Use this time to:
- Fill in any gaps on the checklist
- Make sure your Timeline view shows your Issues
- Review your Copilot-drafted Issue --- did you evaluate and edit it?
- Add any final details to your README

**When you're done, do a self-check using the rubric on your handout.**

---

### Slide 14 --- Train-the-Trainer: Why Teaching Matters

**The best way to prove you know something is to teach it.**

On a farm, you teach all the time:
- Showing a new hire how to operate equipment
- Teaching your kids how to check on livestock
- Explaining your irrigation schedule to a neighbor helping out

**The same skills apply to GitHub.** If you can teach a concept clearly, you truly understand it.

*"To teach is to learn twice."* --- Joseph Joubert

---

### Slide 15 --- The 4-Step Teaching Method

**When teaching any skill, follow these four steps:**

| Step | What You Do | Farm Example |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **1. SHOW** | Demonstrate the skill while they watch | "Watch me start the tractor" |
| **2. EXPLAIN** | Talk through WHY each step matters | "I check the oil first because..." |
| **3. LET THEM TRY** | Hand over control and let them practice | "Now you start it" |
| **4. GIVE FEEDBACK** | Tell them what went well and what to adjust | "Great start --- next time, check mirrors first" |

**This is how experienced farmers have always taught.** Today you'll use the same approach for GitHub.

---

### Slide 16 --- Peer Teaching Assignment

**Your task: Teach ONE GitHub concept to a partner.**

Choose one of these topics (or propose your own):
- How to create an Issue with labels
- How to set up a Project board
- How to create an Issue template
- How to use Copilot to draft an Issue
- How to add custom fields to a Project
- How to set up iterations on a Project
- How to use the Timeline view

**You have 5 minutes to prepare, then 5 minutes to teach your partner. Your partner will then teach you their topic.**

---

### Slide 17 --- Preparing Your Mini-Lesson

**Take 5 minutes to prepare.**

Use this framework:
1. **What** is the skill? (One sentence)
2. **Why** does it matter for a farm? (One sentence)
3. **How** do you do it? (3-5 steps, keep it simple)
4. **What should they watch for?** (One common mistake or tip)

**Write your notes on a scrap of paper or on your handout.**

You do NOT need slides. Just show them on the screen.

> Instructor note: Walk around and help learners who are unsure what to teach. Suggest they pick the skill they felt most confident about during the capstone. Reassure them: "You don't need to be perfect. Just walk them through it the way you'd show a neighbor."

---

### Slide 18 --- Peer Teaching Time

**Time to teach!**

**Round 1 (5 minutes):** Person A teaches Person B.
- Use the 4-step method: Show, Explain, Let Them Try, Give Feedback
- The "student" should actually do the steps on their own screen

**Round 2 (5 minutes):** Person B teaches Person A.
- Same method. Different topic.

**After both rounds:** Give each other one piece of positive feedback and one suggestion.

> Instructor note: Set a timer for 5 minutes per round. Announce when to switch. Walk around and observe --- this is excellent L2 assessment data. Note who can teach independently, who needs support, and what topics learners chose.

---

### Slide 19 --- Teaching Debrief

**How did it go?**

- What was the hardest part about teaching?
- Did explaining it help you understand it better?
- What did your partner teach you that you didn't fully understand before?
- Would you feel comfortable teaching this to someone outside this class?

> Instructor note: Ask 3-4 learners to share. Common answers: "Explaining WHY was harder than showing HOW," "I realized I knew more than I thought," "My partner asked a question I hadn't considered." Use these to reinforce that teaching deepens learning.

---

### Slide 20 --- Capstone Showcase

**Let's see what you built!**

**Volunteer showcase:** 3-4 learners share their capstone repository with the group.

For each showcase:
1. Show your repository and README (30 seconds)
2. Show your Project board with Timeline view (30 seconds)
3. Show your Copilot-drafted Issue --- before and after editing (30 seconds)
4. What would you add next if you had more time? (30 seconds)

**Audience:** After each showcase, share one thing you noticed that you'd like to try in your own repository.

> Instructor note: Ask for volunteers, but have 2-3 people in mind to call on if no one volunteers. Keep each showcase to 2 minutes max. Celebrate effort and creativity. Point out unique approaches: "Notice how [learner] organized by season --- that's a great approach for crop planning."

---

### Slide 21 --- Course Completion Celebration

**You did it!**

Twelve sessions. From zero to:
- Creating and managing repositories
- Tracking work with Issues and Projects
- Collaborating with Pull Requests
- Building templates and automations
- Using AI tools to work faster
- Teaching others what you've learned

**That's not just learning GitHub. That's building a digital management system for your farm.**

Give yourself --- and your classmates --- a round of applause.

> Instructor note: This is the celebration moment. Be genuine and enthusiastic. If you have certificates, distribute them now. If you have any small tokens of completion (stickers, printed certificates, etc.), this is the time.

---

### Slide 22 --- What's Next: Continuing Your Journey

**GitHub doesn't stop when this class ends.**

**Keep practicing:**
- Use your capstone repository for real farm tasks this season
- Create a new repository for each major project or season
- Teach a family member or neighbor what you learned

**Resources:**
- GitHub Docs: docs.github.com
- GitHub Skills: skills.github.com (free interactive courses)
- GitHub Community: github.community
- Your classmates --- you're all part of a network now

**Remember:** Every expert was once a beginner. You've built the foundation. The rest is practice.

---

### Slide 23 --- Final Feedback Survey

**Please fill out the course completion survey before you leave.**

This survey covers:
- Your experience across all 12 sessions
- What was most valuable
- What could be improved
- Whether you plan to continue using GitHub

**Your honest feedback shapes future sessions for other farmers.**

---

### Slide 24 --- Thank You & Graduation

**Thank you for twelve sessions of hard work, curiosity, and persistence.**

You came in as farmers. You're leaving as farmers who manage their operations with one of the most powerful collaboration tools in the world.

Go build something great --- on your farm and on GitHub.

**Congratulations, graduates!**

## UDL Implementation Notes

### Representation (3+ modes)
1. **Visual:** Projected slides with rubric tables, journey summary table, and step-by-step setup screenshots; capstone checklist displayed on screen throughout work time
2. **Verbal:** Instructor narration during capstone facilitation; peer teaching exercise provides verbal explanation practice; group showcase presentations
3. **Written:** Printed Capstone Guide handout with step-by-step instructions; printed rubric for self-assessment; lab exercise with full requirements checklist
4. **Tabular:** Rubric scoring table, course journey summary table, 4-step teaching method table, and progress milestone table provide structured reference
5. **Kinesthetic/experiential:** Capstone is entirely hands-on construction; peer teaching requires live demonstration on screen; showcase requires presenting to the group

### Engagement (learner choice)
- **Three scenario options** for capstone (crops, equipment, livestock) plus "create your own" option
- **Peer teaching topic choice** --- learners select the skill they feel most confident about
- **"Why This Matters for YOUR Farm"** opening connecting to real farm management needs
- **Self-paced capstone work** --- learners work at their own speed using the checklist
- **Showcase is voluntary** --- volunteers present, reducing anxiety for less confident learners
- **Open-ended capstone** --- no single "right answer," allowing personalization to each farm

### Action & Expression (multi-method assessment)
- **L1 (Reaction):** Course completion feedback survey covering all 12 sessions
- **L2 (Observation):** Capstone-specific skills checklist (repository setup, Issues, Project board, templates, Copilot use, peer teaching); 4-step teaching observation
- **Hands-on product:** Complete farm repository with all required components --- the most comprehensive artifact of the entire course
- **Peer teaching:** Learners demonstrate understanding by teaching a concept to a partner, assessed via the 4-step method
- **Verbal presentation:** Capstone showcase requires learners to explain their design choices
- **Self-assessment:** Rubric-based self-check before showcase; reflection on teaching experience
- **Written reflection:** Lab exercise includes reflection questions on both capstone and teaching
