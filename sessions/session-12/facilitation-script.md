## Phase 1: Welcome & Framing (10 min) --- 0:00

**[Slide 1-2: Title, Welcome to the Final Session]**

> "Good [morning/afternoon]. Welcome to Session 12 --- the final session. Take a moment to let that sink in. Twelve sessions ago, most of you had never opened GitHub. Today, you're going to build a complete farm management system from scratch, and then teach someone else how to use part of it."

> "This session is different from the others. I'm going to talk less, and you're going to do more. Most of today is YOUR time to create and to share."

**[Slide 3: Why This Matters for YOUR Farm]**

> "Here's why this matters. After today, there's no instructor. If you want to set up a new repository for next season, you need to do it yourself. If a family member or neighbor wants to learn what you've learned, YOU become the teacher."

> "So let me ask: What's one thing you wish you'd had organized on GitHub at the start of this past season?"

*Let 2-3 learners share. Write their answers on the whiteboard.*

> "Those are exactly the kinds of things you can build today. Your capstone isn't a school exercise --- it's a real system you could start using tomorrow."

**[Slide 4: Your Learning Journey]**

> "Let's take 60 seconds to look at where you've been."

*Show the journey table. Read through it quickly, pausing at key milestones.*

> "Session 1: You learned to navigate GitHub. Session 3: You built your first Project board. Session 6: You created templates. Session 8: You set up automated workflows. Session 10: You met Copilot. And now --- Session 12 --- you put it ALL together."

> "Every one of these skills shows up in today's capstone. You've already practiced each piece. Today you assemble the whole picture."

---

## Phase 2: Capstone Brief (5 min) --- 0:10

**[Slide 5-8: Capstone Big Picture, Requirements, Scenarios, Rubric]**

> "Here's what you're building: a complete farm repository from scratch. Think of it as setting up a brand-new farm office. You need the building, the filing system, the planning wall, the work order forms, the schedule, and your AI helper."

*Distribute handouts: Lab Exercise and Capstone Guide.*

> "Open your Lab Exercise handout. Page 1 has the full requirements checklist. Let me walk through the highlights."

*Read through the checklist quickly --- don't belabor each item:*

> "Repository with a README. At least 5 Issues. At least 4 custom labels. At least 1 Issue template. A Project board with custom fields, iterations, and a Timeline view. And at least 1 Issue drafted with Copilot."

> "That's the full list. Your Capstone Guide handout has step-by-step instructions if you get stuck on any piece."

**[Slide 7: Choose Your Scenario]**

> "Pick your scenario. Crops, equipment, livestock --- or create your own. The lab exercise has detailed suggestions for each scenario, but you don't have to follow them exactly. Make it match YOUR farm."

**[Slide 8: Rubric]**

> "The rubric is on your handout. Let me show you how it works."

*Walk through ONE row --- Repository Setup --- to show scoring:*

> "Excellent means a descriptive name, a detailed README, and a clear description. Good means name and README are present. Developing means it's created but minimal. Beginning means it barely exists. The target is 18 out of 24. Aim for Excellent on the things you're best at."

> "Any questions before we start? No? Let's build."

---

## Phase 3: Capstone Work Time (50 min) --- 0:15

**[Slide 9-10: Getting Started, Work Time Begins]**

> "You have 50 minutes. Start with your repository --- name it, create it, add a README. That should take about 5 minutes. Then move through the checklist. The suggested order is on the slide and on your Capstone Guide."

> "If you get stuck: first, check your Capstone Guide. Second, ask your neighbor. Third, raise your hand."

*Start the timer. Display it visibly.*

> "Go."

**Facilitation during work time:**

Walk the room continuously. Your job during this phase:

1. **Monitor progress** --- Glance at screens to see where each learner is
2. **Unblock quickly** --- If someone is stuck for more than 2 minutes, step in with a targeted hint (not a full solution)
3. **Observe for L2 assessment** --- Use the checklist below
4. **Give encouragement** --- "Your Project board looks great" or "Nice job with those labels"
5. **Redirect perfectionists** --- "Done is better than perfect. Move on to the next item and come back if you have time."

**Common support needs during capstone:**

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|------------|
| Learner doesn't know where to start | "Start with the repository. Click the + button, name it, add a README. That's step 1." |
| Learner is spending too long on README | "Two to three sentences is enough. Move on to Issues --- that's where the real work is." |
| Learner forgot how to create labels | "Go to Issues > Labels. Your Capstone Guide has the steps." |
| Learner can't remember Issue templates | "Settings > General > scroll to Features > Set up templates. The Guide has screenshots." |
| Learner's Project board is empty | "You need to add your Issues to the Project. Click + Add item and search for them." |
| Learner forgot custom fields | "In your Project, click the + next to column headers, or go to Project Settings > Custom fields." |
| Learner can't set up iterations | "In your Project settings, look for Iterations under custom fields. Add a new iteration field." |
| Learner's Timeline is blank | "Issues need date values. Set start and end dates in the table view, then switch to Roadmap/Timeline." |
| Learner isn't sure about Copilot | "Open a new Issue, click the Copilot icon, and type a detailed prompt. Your Session 10 handout has tips." |
| Learner finishes early | "Great work! Try the stretch challenges on your lab exercise. Or help your neighbor." |

**Time announcements:**

- **At 15 minutes (0:30):** "You should have your repository and be working on Issues. If you're not there yet, move quickly --- don't overthink the README."
- **At 25 minutes (0:40):** "Halfway through. You should be moving from Issues to the Project board. If you haven't used Copilot yet, do your Copilot Issue next."
- **At 40 minutes (0:55):** "Ten minutes left in this block. Focus on getting your Project board set up with at least one custom field. Timeline view is next."
- **At 48 minutes (1:03):** "Two minutes to a natural stopping point. After the break you'll have 10 more minutes to finish up."

---

## BREAK (15 min) --- 1:05

**[Slide 12: Break]**

> "Take 15 minutes. You're doing great. When we come back, you'll have 10 more minutes to finish your capstone, and then we shift to the teaching exercise."

> "During the break, think about this: Which GitHub skill are you most confident about? That's what you'll teach to a partner after the break."

**During the break:**
- Walk around and note which learners are furthest behind --- they may need extra support in the final 10 minutes
- Check that all handouts are distributed
- Prepare the whiteboard for the showcase: write "Capstone Showcase" and space for 3-4 presenter names
- Set up any celebration items (certificates, etc.)

---

## Phase 4: Final Capstone Work (10 min) --- 1:20

**[Slide 13: Final Capstone Work Time]**

> "Welcome back. You have 10 more minutes to finish your capstone. Use the checklist --- fill in any gaps. If you're done, do the self-assessment with the rubric on your handout."

*Start the timer. Walk the room. Prioritize helping learners who are behind.*

> **At 5 minutes (1:25):** "Five minutes. If you're missing the Timeline view or Copilot Issue, focus on those now."

> **At 9 minutes (1:29):** "One minute. Wrap up what you're working on. We're about to shift gears."

---

## Phase 5: Train-the-Trainer Introduction (5 min) --- 1:30

**[Slide 14-15: Why Teaching Matters, 4-Step Method]**

> "Alright, capstones down --- for now. We're shifting to the second part of today's session: teaching."

> "Here's a question. On your farm, how do you teach someone a new skill? Think about showing a new hire how to back up a trailer, or teaching a kid how to check the animals."

*Let 1-2 learners answer.*

> "Most of you said something like: 'I show them, then I let them try.' That's exactly the method we're going to use today. It's called the 4-step method."

*Show the table on Slide 15:*

> "Step 1: SHOW --- demonstrate while they watch. Step 2: EXPLAIN --- talk through why each step matters, not just what buttons to click. Step 3: LET THEM TRY --- hand over the keyboard and let them do it. Step 4: GIVE FEEDBACK --- tell them what went well and what to adjust."

> "This is how experienced farmers have always taught. Today, you're the experienced one. You've been doing GitHub for twelve sessions. Your partner needs your help."

---

## Phase 6: Lesson Preparation (5 min) --- 1:35

**[Slide 16-17: Peer Teaching Assignment, Preparing Your Lesson]**

> "Pick ONE topic from the list on the slide --- or choose your own. Pick the skill you feel most confident about. You don't need to be perfect. Just walk your partner through it the way you'd show a neighbor."

> "On your handout, Part 2 has a preparation framework. You have 5 minutes to plan. Write down: What is the skill? Why does it matter? What are the steps? What's one tip or common mistake?"

> "You do NOT need slides. You'll show your partner on your screen. Go --- 5 minutes."

*Walk around. If a learner can't decide what to teach:*

> "What felt easiest for you during the capstone? Teach that. If Issues were easy, teach Issues. If the Project board clicked for you, teach that."

*If a learner says "I don't know it well enough to teach":*

> "You don't need to be an expert. If you can do it, you can show someone. Start with 'Watch me do this' and go from there."

---

## Phase 7: Peer Teaching (10 min) --- 1:40

**[Slide 18: Peer Teaching Time]**

> "Time to teach! Here's how this works."

> "Round 1: Person on the LEFT teaches. Person on the RIGHT is the student. You have 5 minutes. Use the 4-step method: Show it, explain it, let them try it, give feedback."

> "The student should actually DO the steps on their own screen. This isn't just watching --- it's practicing."

> "Ready? Go."

*Start a 5-minute timer. Walk the room. Observe:*
- Are learners demonstrating first (SHOW) or jumping straight to instructions?
- Are they explaining WHY, not just WHERE to click?
- Are they letting their partner actually try it?
- Are they giving feedback?

*Note observations on your L2 checklist.*

> **At 5 minutes:** "Switch! Person on the RIGHT teaches now. Person on the LEFT is the student. Same method. 5 minutes. Go."

*Start another 5-minute timer. Continue observing.*

> **At 10 minutes:** "Time. Great work, everyone."

---

## Phase 8: Teaching Debrief (5 min) --- 1:50

**[Slide 19: Teaching Debrief]**

> "How did that go? Let's hear from a few of you."

> "What was the hardest part about teaching?"

*Take 2 responses. Common: "Explaining WHY was harder than showing HOW" or "I realized I skipped steps I take for granted."*

> "Did explaining the skill help you understand it better?"

*Take 1-2 responses. Most will say yes.*

> "Would you feel comfortable teaching this to someone outside this class --- a family member, a neighbor, a farmhand?"

*Take 1-2 responses.*

> "Here's the big insight: teaching is the highest level of learning. If you can teach it, you own it. And now you have the confidence to spread this knowledge beyond this room."

---

## Phase 9: Capstone Showcase (20 min) --- 1:55

**[Slide 20: Capstone Showcase]**

> "Now let's see what you built. I need 3 or 4 volunteers to show your capstone repository to the group. You'll have 2 minutes each."

*If no one volunteers immediately:*

> "I noticed some really impressive work while I was walking around. [Name], your Project board looked great --- would you be willing to share? [Name], I saw your Copilot Issue was really well edited --- how about you?"

*For each presenter:*

> "Show us four things: your repository and README, your Project board with Timeline view, your Copilot-drafted Issue before and after editing, and what you'd add next if you had more time. Two minutes. Go."

*After each presentation:*

> "Let's give [Name] a hand. What's one thing you noticed that you'd like to try?"

*Take 1 response from the audience. Keep it moving.*

**Showcase facilitation tips:**
- Keep strict time: 2 minutes per presenter, gently cut off if needed
- Celebrate EFFORT and CREATIVITY, not perfection
- Point out unique approaches: "Notice how [Name] used seasons as labels --- that's a smart organizing principle"
- If someone's capstone is incomplete, focus on what they DID build: "You got a solid set of Issues and a working board --- that's a strong foundation"
- Connect to real-world use: "This is exactly the kind of system you could use for your spring planning"

---

## Phase 10: Celebration & Closing (10 min) --- 2:15

**[Slide 21: Course Completion Celebration]**

> "Let's take a step back. Twelve sessions. Think about where you started and where you are now."

*Pause. Let it land.*

> "In Session 1, you were figuring out what a repository even was. Today, you built a complete farm management system from scratch --- with Issues, labels, templates, a Project board, custom fields, iterations, a Timeline view, and AI-assisted content. And you taught part of it to someone else."

> "That is a remarkable achievement. Give yourselves --- and your classmates --- a round of applause."

*Lead the applause. Be genuine.*

*If distributing certificates:*

> "I have something for each of you."

*Hand out certificates. Shake hands. Take a group photo if appropriate.*

**[Slide 22: What's Next]**

> "GitHub doesn't end when you walk out that door. Here's how to keep going."

> "First: Use your capstone repository. For real. This season, when you have a task to track, open GitHub and create an Issue. The more you use it, the more natural it becomes."

> "Second: Teach someone. You practiced that today. When a neighbor asks how you stay organized, show them."

> "Third: Keep learning. GitHub Skills at skills.github.com has free interactive courses. The GitHub community forums are a great place to ask questions. And you have each other --- you're all connected now."

> "Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. You've built the foundation. The rest is practice."

---

## Phase 11: Survey & Farewell (5 min) --- 2:25

**[Slide 23-24: Feedback Survey, Thank You]**

> "One last thing before you go. Please fill out the course completion survey. This one covers all 12 sessions, not just today. Your honest feedback helps us make this better for future farmers."

*Distribute surveys if paper, or provide the link if digital.*

> "Take your time with the survey. I'll be here for another 15 minutes if you have questions or want to chat."

> "Thank you for twelve sessions of hard work, curiosity, and patience. You came in as farmers. You're leaving as farmers who manage their operations with one of the most powerful collaboration tools in the world."

> "Go build something great --- on your farm and on GitHub. Congratulations, graduates."

---

## Buffer (15 min) --- 2:30

Use this time for:
- Collecting remaining surveys
- Helping learners who want to finish capstone work
- Answering individual questions about continuing with GitHub
- Taking group or individual photos
- Sharing contact information or community links
- 1-on-1 conversations with learners about their plans
- Distributing any remaining certificates or materials
- Thanking learners individually as they leave

## L2 Observation Checklist

**During the capstone and peer teaching, observe whether each learner can:**

- [ ] **Create a repository with README** --- Set up a new repository with a descriptive name and meaningful README content
- [ ] **Create detailed Issues with labels** --- Write Issues with descriptions, checklists, and appropriate custom labels applied
- [ ] **Build a Project board** --- Create a Project, add Issues, and configure at least Board view with columns
- [ ] **Configure custom fields and iterations** --- Add custom fields to the Project and set up iteration cycles
- [ ] **Use Timeline view** --- Create a Roadmap/Timeline view with Issues displayed on a date-based timeline
- [ ] **Create an Issue template** --- Build a reusable Issue template with relevant sections and placeholder text
- [ ] **Use Copilot effectively** --- Draft an Issue with Copilot, evaluate the output, and edit it with farm-specific improvements
- [ ] **Teach a concept using the 4-step method** --- Demonstrate, explain, let the partner try, and give feedback
- [ ] **Present and explain their work** --- Articulate design choices and show their capstone to others (if in showcase)

**Scoring guidance:**

## Emergency Procedures

**Internet goes down:**
- Shift immediately to peer teaching and reflection activities (these can work without internet)
- Have learners plan their capstone on paper: draw their Project board, write Issue titles and descriptions, sketch their label scheme
- Use printed screenshots of key GitHub screens for reference
- When internet returns, learners execute their paper plans
- If internet doesn't return, capstone becomes a planning exercise and learners complete the build at home

**Projector fails:**
- Walk around and work with learners individually
- Pair experienced learners with those who need more help
- Use printed handouts as primary reference
- For the showcase, have presenters walk around and show their screens to small groups

**Learner is significantly behind on capstone:**
- Prioritize the core elements: repository, 3 Issues, and a Project board
- Skip iterations and Timeline if time is short
- Pair them with a faster learner for the teaching exercise so they learn by being taught
- Reassure them: "You've learned the skills. You can finish this at home."

**Learner is anxious about peer teaching:**
- Reassure: "You don't need to be perfect. Just show them what you did."
- Suggest they teach the simplest skill they're comfortable with (e.g., creating an Issue)
- Offer to be their partner if they're very anxious
- Remind them: "You've been doing this for twelve sessions. You know more than you think."

**Copilot is unavailable:**
- Have learners write a prompt on paper and describe what they'd expect Copilot to generate
- Provide a printed example of Copilot output for them to evaluate and edit
- Score the Copilot rubric row based on their ability to write a good prompt and evaluate sample output

---

## Guidance: Facilitating the Final Session

**Tone:** This session should feel celebratory and empowering, not stressful. Learners have worked hard for twelve sessions. Your job today is to step back, let them create, and celebrate what they've built.

**Pacing:** The capstone work time will feel long to you but fast to learners. Resist the urge to interrupt with announcements. Time checks at the 15/25/40-minute marks are sufficient.

**Struggling learners:** Some learners will not finish the full checklist. That's okay. Focus on what they DID accomplish, not what they missed. A repository with 3 good Issues and a Project board is a real achievement.

**Showcase nerves:** Some learners will be reluctant to present. Don't force anyone, but do encourage. Having 2-3 presenters in mind (people you noticed doing strong work) helps if no one volunteers.

**Emotional closing:** For some learners, this is a significant accomplishment. They may have never used a computer tool this complex before. Acknowledge that. The closing should be warm, genuine, and forward-looking.

**After the session:** Document attendance, L2 observations, and survey results. Note common gaps that could inform future curriculum revisions. Celebrate your own accomplishment --- you taught twelve sessions of technical training to a non-technical audience.

---

## Post-Session Notes

After the session, document:
- [ ] Final attendance count (and overall course attendance patterns)
- [ ] L1 feedback survey results (session-level and course-level)
- [ ] L2 observation notes (skills demonstrated/not demonstrated per learner)
- [ ] Capstone completion rates: how many learners met minimum, target, and stretch criteria

- [ ] Peer teaching observations: quality of instruction, topics chosen, 4-step method adherence
- [ ] Showcase notes: what stood out, what learners found impressive
- [ ] Learner confidence levels from reflection questions
- [ ] Common gaps or skills that need more practice (for curriculum revision)
- [ ] Quotes or feedback worth capturing for program documentation
- [ ] Any technical issues that affected the session
- [ ] Recommendations for future cohorts (what to change, what to keep)
- [ ] Follow-up plan: will there be a check-in session, community channel, or continued support?
