    <p>Twelve sessions ago, many of you had never heard of GitHub. Today, you're about to build a complete farm management system — and teach someone else how to use it.</p>
    <p><b>This session has two parts:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Capstone Project</b> — Build a complete farm repository using every skill you've learned</li>
      <li><b>Train-the-Trainer</b> — Practice teaching a GitHub concept to a peer</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Today is <b>YOUR</b> day. Less instruction from me, more creation from you.</p>
