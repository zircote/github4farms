    <p><b>Agents = A Farmhand Who Follows Multi-Step Instructions on Their Own</b></p>
    <p>Copilot helped you write one suggestion at a time. An agent handles a whole sequence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read through your repository</li>
      <li>Identify what needs to be done</li>
      <li>Create Issues, suggest changes, or organize tasks</li>
      <li>Work through multiple steps without you guiding each one</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Key difference:</b> Copilot suggests one thing at a time. An agent follows a plan with multiple steps.</p>
