## Slide Deck

> **Duration:** 165 minutes (2 hours 45 minutes; includes 15-minute buffer)
> **Bloom's Level:** Apply / Analyze
> **Prerequisites:** Sessions 1-4 (GitHub account, repositories, Issues, Projects, Pull Requests)
> **Format:** 24pt+ headers, 18pt+ body text, high-contrast, descriptive alt text on all images

---

### Slide 1 — Title

**Notifications & Team Communication**
*Staying Connected Without Information Overload*

Session 5 of 12 — GitHub Training for Farmers

---

### Slide 2 — Welcome Back

**Welcome to Session 5!**

So far you've learned to:
- Navigate repositories and files (Session 1)
- Track tasks with Issues (Session 2)
- Organize work with Projects (Session 3)
- Collaborate with Pull Requests (Session 4)

Today you'll learn to **stay updated** on what's happening — without checking GitHub every five minutes.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

How do you find out when something changes on your farm right now?

- Someone calls or texts you?
- You notice it in person?
- You find out too late?

*Has anyone ever missed an important update because nobody told them?*

> Instructor note: Let 2-3 learners answer. "What's the cost when a change happens and the right person doesn't find out in time?"

---

### Slide 4 — The Problem

**Important updates get missed.**

- Someone closes an Issue and you don't know the task is done
- A Pull Request sits waiting for review because nobody saw it
- A teammate adds a comment to an Issue but you never check
- You check GitHub constantly "just in case" — that's exhausting

**What if GitHub could tell you when something happens that matters to you?**

---

### Slide 5 — Three Ways to Communicate on GitHub

**GitHub has three built-in communication tools:**

1. **Notifications** — GitHub tells you when something happens in a repository you're watching
2. **@mentions** — You tag a specific person in a comment to get their attention
3. **Discussions** — A forum-style space for questions, ideas, and conversations that aren't tasks

Each one works differently. Today you'll learn when to use which.

---

### Slide 6 — Notifications: Your GitHub Inbox

**Notifications = Automatic Updates**

When you **watch** a repository, GitHub sends you a notification whenever:
- A new Issue is created
- Someone comments on an Issue
- A Pull Request is opened or merged
- Someone @mentions you

**Where do notifications appear?**
- **Bell icon** (top right of any GitHub page) — your notification inbox
- **Email** — GitHub can email you too (you choose)

Think of it like signing up for text alerts from your seed supplier — you get a message whenever there's news.

---

### Slide 7 — Watching a Repository

**To start getting notifications, "watch" a repository:**

1. Go to the repository
2. Click the **"Watch"** button (top right area, near Fork and Star)
3. Choose your level:
   - **Participating and @mentions** — Only notified when you're involved or tagged (default)
   - **All Activity** — Notified about everything
   - **Ignore** — No notifications at all
   - **Custom** — Pick exactly what you want (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.)

**Recommended for most farmers:** Start with **"All Activity"** on your main farm repository. You can always turn it down later.

> Instructor note: Show the Watch dropdown on the projector. Demonstrate each option. Recommend "All Activity" for beginners since the demo repo has low volume.

---

### Slide 8 — Your Notification Inbox

**The bell icon is your GitHub inbox.**

Click the **bell icon** (top right of any page) to see your notifications:

- **Unread** notifications appear with a blue dot
- Click a notification to go directly to the Issue, PR, or comment
- Click **"Done"** to mark it as read
- Click **"Unsubscribe"** to stop notifications for that specific thread

**Your inbox groups notifications by repository** — so you can see all farm updates together.

---

### Slide 9 — Email Notifications

**GitHub can also send notifications to your email.**

To check your email settings:
1. Click your **profile icon** (top right) → **"Settings"**
2. Click **"Notifications"** in the left menu
3. Under "Email notification preferences," make sure your email is listed
4. Choose what you want emailed vs. shown only on GitHub

**Tip for farmers:** If you check email more than GitHub, turn on email notifications. If you prefer to check GitHub directly, turn email off to avoid a flooded inbox.

> Instructor note: Show the notification settings page. Don't change anyone's settings — just show them where it is.

---

### Slide 10 — @mentions: Getting Someone's Attention

**@mention = Tapping someone on the shoulder**

To get a specific person's attention, type **@** followed by their username in any comment:

> "@maria Can you check the irrigation pump this week?"

When you @mention someone:
- They get a notification (bell + email if enabled)
- Their name appears as a link in the comment
- They can click the notification to go directly to the comment

**When to use @mentions:**
- Assigning a task to someone in a comment
- Asking a specific person a question
- Letting someone know about a change that affects them

> Instructor note: Demo typing an @mention in an Issue comment. Show the autocomplete dropdown that appears when you type @.

---

### Slide 11 — @mention Examples for the Farm

**Real farm examples of @mentions:**

| Situation | @mention Comment |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Irrigation needs checking | "@tom Irrigation pump in Field 2 is making a noise. Can you check before Friday?" |
| Vet visit scheduled | "@maria Vet confirmed for Tuesday at 9am for Herd B vaccinations." |
| Equipment ordered | "@allen Replacement nozzle ordered. Should arrive Thursday." |
| Grant deadline | "@sarah EQIP report is due June 15. Can you review the draft this week?" |

**Tip:** You can @mention more than one person in the same comment.

---

### Slide 12 — GitHub Discussions: Your Farm Forum

**Discussions = Bulletin Board for Your Farm**

GitHub Discussions is a built-in forum where your team can:
- **Ask questions** — "Has anyone tried no-till for soybeans?"
- **Share ideas** — "Should we try cover crops next season?"
- **Make announcements** — "Equipment auction next Saturday"
- **Have conversations** that don't belong in an Issue

**How is a Discussion different from an Issue?**

| | Issue | Discussion |
|--|-------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | A task to be done | A conversation to have |
| **Outcome** | Gets closed when done | Stays open for ongoing talk |
| **Example** | "Fix fence in north pasture" | "What cover crops work best in our soil?" |

---

### Slide 13 — Using Discussions

**To start a Discussion:**

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the **"Discussions"** tab (near Issues and Pull Requests)
3. Click **"New discussion"**
4. Choose a category:
   - **General** — anything
   - **Q&A** — questions that can be marked as answered
   - **Ideas** — suggestions and proposals
   - **Show and tell** — share something you've done
5. Write your question or topic
6. Click **"Start discussion"**

**To reply:** Scroll to the bottom, type your response, click **"Comment"**

> Instructor note: If Discussions is not enabled on the demo repo, enable it beforehand in repository Settings → Features → Discussions.

---

### Slide 14 — When to Use Which Communication Method

**Choose the right tool for the situation:**

| Situation | Best Tool | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| "Fix the broken fence post" | **Issue** | It's a task with a clear end point |
| "Check the irrigation pump" | **@mention** in an Issue comment | Directing a task to a specific person |
| "What cover crops work best?" | **Discussion** | Open-ended question, no single answer |
| "Who's available Saturday?" | **Discussion** | Group coordination, not a task |
| "The Pull Request is ready for review" | **@mention** in a PR comment | Getting a specific reviewer's attention |
| Staying up to date on all farm activity | **Watch** the repository | Automatic notifications for everything |

---

### Slide 15 — Managing Notification Volume

**Too many notifications? Here's how to manage them.**

**Problem:** You're getting notifications for things that don't matter to you.

**Solutions:**
1. **Change your Watch level** — switch from "All Activity" to "Participating and @mentions"
2. **Unsubscribe** from specific threads — click "Unsubscribe" on any notification
3. **Filter notifications** — in your inbox, use the filter dropdown to show only Issues, PRs, or @mentions
4. **Adjust email settings** — turn off email for low-priority notifications

**Start with more notifications, then trim down.** It's easier to turn things off than to miss something important.

> Instructor note: This is an "Analyze" level skill. Don't spend too long here — learners will figure out their preferences with practice.

---

### Slide 16 — Live Demo: Notifications, @mentions, and Discussions

**Watch me demonstrate all three communication tools.**

I'm going to:
1. **Watch** the demo farm repository (set to All Activity)
2. Open an Issue and **@mention** someone in a comment
3. Show the **notification inbox** — the @mention appears
4. Create a new **Discussion** — "What should we plant in Field 4 this year?"
5. Reply to the Discussion

**Just watch — you'll practice all of this next.**

> Instructor note: Use two accounts to show both sides (sender and receiver). Show the bell icon notification appearing after the @mention.

---

### Slide 17 — Guided Practice Introduction

**Your turn! Follow along with me.**

You and your partner will:
1. Watch the demo repository
2. @mention each other in Issue comments
3. Check your notification inbox
4. Post in a Discussion

I'll walk through each step. If you get stuck, ask your partner or raise your hand.

> Instructor note: Pair learners. Distribute lab exercise handout.

---

### Slide 18 — Guided Practice Steps

**Follow along with me:**

**Step 1: Watch the repository**
1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click **"Watch"** → select **"All Activity"**

**Step 2: @mention your partner**
1. Open any existing Issue
2. Scroll to the comment box
3. Type: "@[partner's username] What do you think about this task?"
4. Click **"Comment"**

**Step 3: Check your notifications**
1. Click the **bell icon** (top right)
2. Find the notification from your partner's @mention
3. Click it to go to the comment

**Checkpoint:** Both you and your partner should have received a notification from each other's @mention.

> Instructor note: Pause at checkpoint. "Raise your hand when you see a notification from your partner."

---

### Slide 19 — BREAK (15 Minutes)

**Take 15 minutes.**

When we come back, you'll practice using all three communication tools on your own!

---

### Slide 20 — Independent Practice

**Your challenge: Use all three communication tools.**

1. **Create a new Issue** about a farm task and **@mention a classmate** asking them to help
2. **Reply to someone's @mention** with a helpful comment
3. **Start a Discussion** with a farm question (or reply to one)
4. **Check your notification inbox** and handle your notifications (read, respond, or mark done)

**Choose your communication scenario:**
- **Option A: Crop Planning** — Start a Discussion asking what to plant in a field. Create an Issue for the actual planting task and @mention someone to assign it.
- **Option B: Equipment Coordination** — Start a Discussion about scheduling equipment sharing. Create an Issue for a repair task and @mention the mechanic.
- **Option C: Livestock Management** — Start a Discussion about feeding schedule changes. Create an Issue for a vet visit and @mention the person who manages the herd.

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] You are watching the demo repository
- [ ] You @mentioned at least 1 classmate in a comment
- [ ] You responded to at least 1 @mention you received
- [ ] You posted in a Discussion (new thread or reply)
- [ ] You checked your notification inbox and handled at least 2 notifications

---

### Slide 21 — Stretch Challenges

**Finished early? Try these:**

- Change your Watch setting to **"Custom"** and pick specific notification types
- Go to Settings → Notifications and explore your email preferences
- @mention two people in the same comment
- Start a **Q&A Discussion** and see if someone marks your answer as accepted

---

### Slide 22 — Key Vocabulary Review

| GitHub Term | Farm Analogy | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Watch | Sign up for alerts | Subscribe to updates from a repository |
| Notification | Text alert | A message telling you something happened |
| @mention | Tap on the shoulder | Tag a specific person to get their attention |
| Discussion | Bulletin board | Forum for questions and conversations |
| Unsubscribe | Cancel alerts | Stop getting notifications for one thread |
| Inbox (bell icon) | Mailbox | Where your notifications appear on GitHub |

---

### Slide 23 — Reflection

**Think about your farm:**

- What kind of notifications would be most useful for you?
- When would you use an @mention vs. just adding a comment?
- What's a question your farm team discusses often that could be a GitHub Discussion?

**Turn to your partner and share your answers. (3 minutes)**

> Instructor note: Walk around and listen. Note which communication tools generate the most excitement — this may inform how you introduce Discussions in the demo repository.

---

### Slide 24 — What's Next

**Session 6: Basic Workflows & Templates**

Next time, you'll learn to create **reusable templates** for common farm tasks — so you never have to write the same Issue from scratch twice. Think of it like having pre-printed work order forms.

**Optional between-session practice:**
- Watch your own repository (or the demo repo)
- @mention a classmate in an Issue comment and have a short conversation
- Check your notification inbox daily — get used to the bell icon
- Start or reply to a Discussion

---

### Slide 25 — Feedback Survey

**Please fill out the 2-minute survey before you leave.**

---

**Thank you!**

You now know how to stay connected with your farm team on GitHub — without checking constantly.

## UDL Implementation Notes

### Representation (3+ modes)
1. **Visual:** Projected slides with notification inbox screenshots, @mention autocomplete demo
2. **Verbal:** Instructor narration using "text alerts / tap on shoulder / bulletin board" analogies
3. **Written:** Printed notification settings quick-reference guide (take-home)
4. **Social/Interactive:** Paired @mention exchange — learners experience notifications in real time
5. **Tabular:** Comparison tables (Issue vs. Discussion, When to Use Which)

### Engagement (learner choice)
- **Three scenario options** in lab exercise (crops, equipment, livestock)
- **Communication method choice** — learners explore which tools fit their farm
- **Stretch challenges** for fast finishers (custom Watch, email settings, multi-@mention)
- **"Why This Matters for YOUR Farm"** opening with missed-update scenario
- **Real-time peer interaction** — @mentions and Discussions involve actual classmates

### Action & Expression (multi-method assessment)
- **L1 (Reaction):** Paper feedback survey
- **L2 (Observation):** 5-skill checklist (watch repo, @mention, respond to @mention, post Discussion, manage notifications)
- **Hands-on product:** Each learner produces @mention comments, Discussion posts, and managed notification inbox — observable artifacts
- **Verbal reflection:** Partner discussion on "What notifications would be useful on your farm?"
- **Written:** @mention comments and Discussion posts demonstrate communication skills
