# Notification & Communication Settings — Quick-Reference Guide

> **Session 5: Notifications & Team Communication**
> Keep this guide handy when setting up your farm's communication on GitHub.

## Three Communication Tools

| Tool | What It Does | Farm Analogy |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Watch + Notifications** | Automatic updates when things happen | Signing up for text alerts |
| **@mentions** | Tag a specific person in a comment | Tapping someone on the shoulder |
| **Discussions** | Forum for questions and conversations | Bulletin board in the farm office |

---

## Watching a Repository

**To start receiving notifications:**

1. Go to the repository
2. Click **"Watch"** (top right area)
3. Choose your level:

| Level | What You Get | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **All Activity** | Every Issue, comment, PR, and Discussion | Small team, main farm repo |
| **Participating and @mentions** | Only threads you're in or tagged in | Busy repo, you don't need everything |
| **Custom** | You pick (Issues only, PRs only, etc.) | Fine-tuning after you know what matters |
| **Ignore** | Nothing | Repos you don't care about |

**Recommendation:** Start with **All Activity**. Turn it down after a week if it's too much.

## Checking Your Notifications

1. Click the **bell icon** (top right of any GitHub page)
2. **Blue dot** = unread notification
3. Click a notification to go to the comment or Issue
4. Click **"Done"** to mark it as handled
5. Click **"Unsubscribe"** to stop following a specific thread

---

## Email Notifications

**To set up email alerts:**

1. Click your **profile icon** (top right) → **"Settings"**
2. Click **"Notifications"** (left menu)
3. Check that your email address is listed
4. Choose what to receive by email vs. only on GitHub

**Tip:** If you check email more often than GitHub, turn on email notifications. Otherwise, the bell icon is enough.

## @mentions

**To tag someone in a comment:**

1. Type **@** followed by their username (no space)
2. Pick from the dropdown that appears
3. Write your message
4. Click **"Comment"**

**Examples:**

| Situation | What to Write |
|-----------|--------------|
| Assign a task | "@tom Can you check the irrigation pump this week?" |
| Ask a question | "@maria When is the vet coming for Herd B?" |
| Share an update | "@allen Replacement part arrived today." |
| Get a review | "@sarah Can you review this Pull Request?" |

**You can @mention multiple people:** "@tom @maria Can you both look at this?"

## GitHub Discussions

**To start a Discussion:**

1. Go to the repository → **"Discussions"** tab
2. Click **"New discussion"**
3. Pick a category:
   - **General** — anything
   - **Q&A** — questions with answers
   - **Ideas** — suggestions and proposals
   - **Show and tell** — share something
4. Write your topic
5. Click **"Start discussion"**

**To reply:** Scroll down, type your response, click **"Comment"**

## When to Use What

| Situation | Use This |
|-----------|----------|
| A task that needs to be completed | **Issue** |
| Need a specific person's attention | **@mention** in a comment |
| A question or idea for the team | **Discussion** |
| Want updates on everything | **Watch** the repository |
| Need to review someone's changes | **@mention** in a Pull Request |
| Group coordination (not a task) | **Discussion** |

**Quick test:** Does it have a "done" state? → **Issue**. Open-ended conversation? → **Discussion**.

---

## Managing Notification Overload

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many notifications | Change Watch to "Participating and @mentions" |
| Don't care about a specific thread | Click "Unsubscribe" on that notification |
| Inbox is overwhelming | Use filter dropdown to show only Issues or @mentions |
| Email inbox flooded | Turn off email notifications in Settings |

**Start with more, then trim down.** It's easier to turn off notifications than to miss something important.

---

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Watch** | Subscribe to updates from a repository |
| **Notification** | A message that something happened |
| **@mention** | Tag a person in a comment to alert them |
