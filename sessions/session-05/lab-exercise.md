> **Materials:** Computer with browser, access to demo farm repository, a partner
> **Format:** Paired practice, then individual practice with peer interaction

---

## Part 1: Guided Practice — Notifications & @mentions (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Watch the Repository (3 min)

1. Go to the demo farm repository: `https://github.com/zircote/github4farms-training`
2. Click the **"Watch"** button (top right area, near Fork and Star)
3. Select **"All Activity"**

**Checkpoint:** The Watch button should now say **"Unwatch"** — that means you're subscribed.

### Step 2: @mention Your Partner in an Issue Comment (5 min)

1. Click the **"Issues"** tab
2. Open any existing Issue (for example, "Fix broken fence post — north pasture")
3. Scroll to the comment box at the bottom
4. Type a comment that @mentions your partner:
   > @[partner's username] Can you take a look at this task? I think it might need to be done this week.
5. Click **"Comment"**

**Tip:** When you type **@** and start typing a name, GitHub shows a dropdown with matching usernames. Click the name to select it.

**Checkpoint:** Your comment should appear with your partner's username as a clickable blue link.

### Step 3: Check Your Notification Inbox (5 min)

1. Click the **bell icon** in the top right corner of any GitHub page
2. Look for a notification from your partner's @mention
3. Click the notification to go to the comment
4. Read what your partner wrote
5. Click **"Done"** to mark the notification as handled

**Not seeing a notification?** Wait a moment — notifications can take a few seconds. Try refreshing the page.

**Checkpoint:** Both you and your partner should have received and read each other's @mention notification.

### Step 4: Reply to Your Partner's @mention (3 min)

1. From the notification, you should be on the Issue page
2. Scroll to the comment box
3. Type a reply:
   > Thanks for the heads up, @[partner's username]. I'll check on it tomorrow morning.
4. Click **"Comment"**

### Step 5: Start a Discussion (4 min)

1. Go back to the demo farm repository main page
2. Click the **"Discussions"** tab
3. Click **"New discussion"**
4. Choose the **"General"** category
5. Title: **"[Your Name]'s farm question — what would you plant in an open field?"**
6. Body: Write 1-2 sentences about a real question for your farm (or use this example): **"We have an unused 5-acre field. What would you suggest planting this spring?"**
7. Click **"Start discussion"**

**Checkpoint:** Your Discussion should appear in the Discussions list.

## Part 2: Independent Practice — Full Communication Workflow (35 minutes)

Now use all three communication tools on your own with a farm scenario.

### Choose Your Scenario

**Option A: Crop Planning**
- **Discussion:** Start a thread asking classmates what cover crops work best in your area
- **Issue:** Create a new Issue titled "Plan cover crop rotation for Field 4" and @mention a classmate to help research options
- **Notification:** Check your inbox and respond to any @mentions you've received

**Option B: Equipment Coordination**
- **Discussion:** Start a thread asking about scheduling shared equipment during harvest
- **Issue:** Create a new Issue titled "Schedule combine maintenance before harvest" and @mention a classmate to coordinate timing
- **Notification:** Check your inbox and respond to any @mentions you've received

**Option C: Livestock Management**
- **Discussion:** Start a thread asking about best practices for rotational grazing
- **Issue:** Create a new Issue titled "Set up rotational grazing schedule for summer" and @mention a classmate who manages livestock
- **Notification:** Check your inbox and respond to any @mentions you've received

**Need a discussion topic?** Try one of these:
- "What's the best way to keep farm records organized?"
- "How do you decide when to repair vs. replace equipment?"
- "What's one tool or practice that changed how you run your farm?"

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Create an Issue with @mention (8 min)**

**Write down your Issue number:** #_______

**Task 2: Respond to @mentions (7 min)**

4. Write at least 2-3 sentences

**Task 4: Reply to Discussions (7 min)**

## Reflection Questions

Answer these on your lab sheet or discuss with your partner:

1. **How many notifications did you receive during this session?** _______

2. **Which communication tool did you find most useful — @mentions, Discussions, or notifications?** Why?
   _____________________________________________

3. **When would you use an @mention instead of just adding a regular comment?**
   _____________________________________________

4. **What's one question your farm team discusses often that could become a GitHub Discussion?**
   _____________________________________________

5. **Farm application:** How would you set up notifications for your farm repository? (Watch everything? Only @mentions? Email or just the bell icon?)
   _____________________________________________

6. **Issue vs. Discussion:** Write an example of something that should be an Issue and something that should be a Discussion:
   - **Issue:** _____________________________________________
   - **Discussion:** _____________________________________________

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Not receiving notifications | Check that you've clicked "Watch" → "All Activity" on the repository. Also check that you're looking at the bell icon, not your email (email may be delayed) |
| @mention autocomplete not appearing | Make sure you type **@** directly followed by the username (no space). The person must have a GitHub account and must have interacted with the repository |
| Can't find the Discussions tab | Discussions may not be enabled. Ask the instructor to enable it in the repository Settings → Features → Discussions |
| Notification inbox is empty | Try refreshing the page. If your partner hasn't @mentioned you yet, wait for them to complete their step |
| Too many notifications | Click "Done" on notifications you've handled. Click "Unsubscribe" on threads you don't need to follow anymore |
| Can't create a Discussion | Make sure you're on the Discussions tab (not Issues). Click "New discussion" and choose a category before writing |
| @mention sent but partner didn't get it | They may need to refresh their page or click the bell icon. Notifications can take a few seconds to arrive |

*Communication is what makes GitHub useful for teams. Practice @mentioning classmates between sessions — the more you use it, the more natural it feels!*
