## Phase 1: Welcome & Hook (10 min) — 0:00

**Facilitation Script:**

> "Good [morning/afternoon]. Welcome back. Before we start — quick question."

> "How do you find out when something important happens on your farm? Does someone call you? Text you? Or do you find out when you walk past and notice the problem yourself?"

*Let 2-3 learners answer.*

> "What happens when the right person doesn't get the message in time? Maybe a gate was left open and nobody told the person who checks the cattle. Maybe a part arrived and sat in the mailbox for a week because nobody knew it was there."

> "Today we're going to learn how GitHub keeps your team connected. You'll set up **notifications** so GitHub tells you when things happen, learn to **@mention** someone to get their attention, and try **Discussions** for farm conversations that aren't tasks. By the end of today, you'll never have to wonder 'Did anyone see my update?'"

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] Open with a farm question about missed updates
- [ ] Share the "text alerts / tap on the shoulder / bulletin board" analogies
- [ ] State 3 learning outcomes in plain language
- [ ] Connect to prior sessions: "You know how to create Issues and Pull Requests. Today you'll learn how to make sure the right people see them."

## Phase 2: Concrete Experience — Instructor Demo (20 min) — 0:10

**"I Do" — Watch Me Use All Three Communication Tools**

> "I'm going to show you three communication tools on GitHub. Just watch for now."

### Demo 1: Watch a Repository + Notifications (6 min)

> "First — how do you tell GitHub to send you updates? You **watch** a repository."

1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click **Watch** → Show the dropdown options
3. Select **All Activity**

> "Now GitHub will notify me whenever anything happens in this repository — new Issues, comments, Pull Requests, everything."

> "Where do I see these notifications? Right here — the **bell icon** in the top right corner. Think of it as your GitHub mailbox."

4. Click the bell icon — show the notification inbox
5. Point out: unread (blue dot), Done button, Unsubscribe option

> "You can also get notifications by email. I'll show you the settings page."

6. Click profile icon → Settings → Notifications (just show, don't change)

> "For now, the bell icon is the easiest way. Let's see it in action."

### Demo 2: @mention (7 min)

> "What if I need a specific person's attention? That's what @mentions are for. It's like tapping someone on the shoulder."

1. Open an existing Issue (e.g., "Fix broken fence post — north pasture")
2. Click in the comment box
3. Type: "@" and start typing the second account's name

> "See this dropdown? GitHub is suggesting names for me. I'll click the one I want."

4. Complete the comment: "@[name] Can you check on this fence before the cattle are moved to the north pasture?"
5. Click **Comment**

> "Now watch what happens on [name]'s account."

*Switch to second account (or show co-facilitator's screen).*

6. Click the bell icon — show the @mention notification
7. Click the notification to go to the comment

> "[Name] got a notification immediately. They can click it and go right to the comment. That's an @mention — direct, specific, and tracked."

### Demo 3: GitHub Discussions (7 min)

> "Issues are for tasks — things that need to get done. But what about questions, ideas, and conversations? That's what **Discussions** are for. Think of it as a bulletin board in the farm office."

1. Click the **Discussions** tab
2. Click **New discussion**
3. Choose **General** category
4. Title: "What should we plant in Field 4 this year?"
5. Body: "Field 4 has been fallow for a season. I'm thinking corn or soybeans but open to other ideas. What works best after a fallow year?"
6. Click **Start discussion**

> "This isn't a task — there's no 'done' state. It's a conversation. Anyone can reply."

*Switch to second account.*

7. Reply: "I'd suggest soybeans — they fix nitrogen in the soil after fallow. Plus the market price is up this year."

> "See the difference? Issues track work. Discussions track ideas and conversations."

---

## Phase 3: Reflective Observation — Guided Practice (20 min) — 0:30

**"We Do" — Practice Together**

> "Now you'll try all three tools with your partner. I'll walk you through each step."

*Distribute lab exercise handouts.*

### Step 1: Watch the Repository (3 min)

> "Everyone: go to the demo farm repository. Click Watch, select All Activity."

Pause: "Raise your hand when the button says 'Unwatch' — that means you're subscribed."

### Step 2: @mention Your Partner (5 min)

> "Open any Issue in the repository. Scroll to the comment box. Type @ and start typing your partner's GitHub username. Select them from the dropdown."

> "Write something like: '@[partner] Can you take a look at this task? I think it needs to be done this week.' Then click Comment."

Pause: "Raise your hand when your comment is posted with your partner's name highlighted in blue."

### Step 3: Check Notifications (5 min)

> "Now click the bell icon — top right corner. You should see a notification from your partner's @mention. Click it to go to the comment."

Pause: "Raise your hand when you've found your partner's @mention in your notifications."

> "Click 'Done' to mark the notification as handled."

### Step 4: Reply to Your Partner (3 min)

> "Reply to your partner's @mention with a helpful comment. Then click Comment."

### Step 5: Start a Discussion (4 min)

> "Go to the Discussions tab. Click New discussion. Choose General. Write a quick farm question — anything you're curious about. Click Start discussion."

Pause: "Raise your hand when your Discussion is posted."

**Troubleshooting During Guided Practice:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find Watch button | Top right area of the repository page |
| @mention dropdown not appearing | Type @ with no space before the username; the person must have a GitHub account |
| No notification appearing | Wait 10-15 seconds and refresh the page |
| Discussions tab missing | Instructor: enable in repo Settings → Features → Discussions |

---

## Phase 4: Abstract Conceptualization (20 min) — 0:50

**"Now Let's Understand When to Use Each Tool"**

> "You just used three communication tools. Let's talk about when to use each one."

### Concept 1: Choosing the Right Tool (8 min)

Show the comparison table (Slide 14):

> "Here's a simple guide:"
> - **"Something needs to be done"** → Create an **Issue**
> - **"A specific person needs to know"** → Use an **@mention**
> - **"I have a question or idea"** → Start a **Discussion**
> - **"I want to stay updated on everything"** → **Watch** the repository

**Turn and Talk (3 min):**

> "Turn to your partner. Come up with one farm example for each tool: when would you create an Issue, when would you @mention someone, and when would you start a Discussion? You have 3 minutes."

*After 3 minutes, ask 2-3 pairs to share. Write examples on the board if available.*

### Concept 2: Managing Notification Volume (5 min)

> "One common concern: 'Won't I get too many notifications?' The answer is — maybe, at first. But you have full control."

> "You can:"
> 1. "Change your Watch level — 'All Activity' is the most, '@mentions only' is the least"
> 2. "Unsubscribe from specific threads"
> 3. "Turn off email notifications and just use the bell icon"

> "My recommendation: start with All Activity so you learn what's happening. After a week, turn down anything that's noise."

### Concept 3: Issue vs. Discussion (4 min)

> "Here's one more distinction that trips people up. When should you use an Issue vs. a Discussion?"

> "The simplest test: **Does it have a 'done' state?** If yes — Issue. If it's an open-ended conversation — Discussion."

> "Fix the fence? Issue. What cover crops should we try? Discussion. Schedule the vet visit? Issue. What's the best way to manage grazing? Discussion."

---

## BREAK (15 min) — 1:10

> "Take 15 minutes. Stretch, grab a drink, ask me any questions. We'll start back at [time]."

**During break:**
- [ ] Circulate to help anyone who had trouble with notifications
- [ ] Check that Discussions tab is working for all learners
- [ ] Note any widespread confusion for post-break review

---

## Phase 5: Active Experimentation — Independent Practice (35 min) — 1:25

**"You Do" — Use All Three Tools On Your Own**

> "Now you'll practice using all three communication tools with a farm scenario of your choice. Check your lab exercise handout for the full instructions."

> "You'll create an Issue with an @mention, respond to other people's @mentions, start a Discussion, and manage your notifications. Work through the five tasks at your own pace."

> "If you get stuck, check the troubleshooting guide on the last page of your handout."

**Circulate and observe. Use the L2 checklist to note:**
- [ ] Can watch a repository
- [ ] Can @mention a specific person in a comment
- [ ] Can respond to an @mention notification
- [ ] Can create or reply to a Discussion
- [ ] Can manage notifications (mark done, unsubscribe)

**For early finishers:**
> "If you've completed all five tasks, check the stretch challenges on your handout. Try the Custom Watch settings or explore your email notification preferences."

**Common issues during independent practice:**
- **Learners @mentioning the wrong person:** Show them the autocomplete dropdown — "Start typing the username and pick from the list."
- **Notifications not appearing:** "Try refreshing the page. Notifications can take a few seconds."
- **Confusing Issues and Discussions:** "Quick test: does it have a 'done' state? If yes, make it an Issue."

## Phase 6: Reflection (10 min) — 2:00

> "Let's wrap up by thinking about how you'd use these tools on your real farm."

**Partner Share (5 min):**

> "Turn to your partner. Share your answers to these questions:"
> 1. "Which communication tool — notifications, @mentions, or Discussions — would be most useful on your farm? Why?"
> 2. "How would you set up your notification preferences? Watch everything? Only @mentions?"

**Whole Group (5 min):**

> "Who'd like to share? What communication scenarios came up?"

*Take 2-3 volunteers. Celebrate specific examples:*
> "I heard [Name] say they'd use @mentions to coordinate vet visits with their farm manager — that's a perfect use case."

---

## Phase 7: Wrap-Up (10 min) — 2:10

> "Great work today. Here's what we covered:"

1. **Watch** a repository to get automatic notifications
2. **@mention** someone to get their specific attention
3. **Discussions** for questions and conversations that aren't tasks
4. **Managing notifications** so you stay informed without getting overwhelmed

> "Next session — **Session 6: Basic Workflows & Templates** — you'll learn to create reusable templates for common farm tasks. Think of it like having pre-printed work order forms — you fill in the blanks instead of starting from scratch every time."

> "Optional practice before next time: @mention a classmate in an Issue this week, check your notification inbox daily, and browse the Discussions tab."

> "Please fill out the feedback survey before you leave."

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] Summarize 4 key concepts
- [ ] Preview Session 6 and connection to today
- [ ] Distribute feedback survey
- [ ] Mention optional practice
- [ ] Thank learners

---

## Phase 8: Buffer (10 min) — 2:20

- [ ] Help any learner who didn't complete the exercise
- [ ] Collect remaining feedback surveys
- [ ] Note learners who may need extra support
- [ ] Answer remaining questions
- [ ] Clean up test Discussions if the list is getting cluttered
