## Detailed Script

### 0:00–0:10 — Welcome & Hook (10 min)

**[Slide 1-2: Title, Welcome Back]**

> "Welcome back! In our first session, you explored a repository — your digital barn. Last session, you created Issues — your digital work orders. Today we're going to take those work orders and organize them into a planning board. Think of it like a whiteboard where you can see everything that needs doing on your farm."

**[Slide 3: Why This Matters]**

> "Quick question — how do you plan your farm season right now? Show of hands: who uses a wall calendar? A whiteboard? A notebook? Just memory?"

*Pause for responses. Acknowledge each method.*

> "All of those work — until plans change. What happens when it rains for a week and your planting schedule shifts? Or a piece of equipment breaks and you need to reorganize priorities?"

*Let 2-3 learners share experiences.*

**[Slide 4: The Problem]**

> "Farm planning is scattered. Tasks live in different places. There's no single view of everything. Today we're going to fix that."

---

### 0:10–0:30 — Concept Introduction (20 min)

**[Slide 5: What Is a GitHub Project?]**

> "A GitHub Project is a planning board. It takes all those Issues you created last session and lets you see them organized visually. Think of it as a whiteboard with sticky notes — but digital, so everyone can see it and it never gets erased."

**[Slide 6: Three Views]**

> "Projects give you three ways to look at your tasks. Let me walk you through each one."

**[Slide 7: Board View]**

> "Board View is the one most people start with. It looks like columns on a whiteboard. You have 'Todo' on the left, 'In Progress' in the middle, and 'Done' on the right. When you start a task, you drag its card from 'Todo' to 'In Progress.' When it's finished, drag it to 'Done.' Simple as that."

*Show the Board View on the projector. Point to each column.*

**[Slide 8: Table View]**

> "Table View looks like a spreadsheet. Every Issue is a row. You can see the title, status, who's assigned, labels — all at once. You can sort by clicking column headers. This is great when you want to see a lot of detail or find something specific."

**[Slide 9: Timeline View]**

> "Timeline View is like a calendar. It shows when each task starts and ends. This is perfect for planting schedules — you can see your whole season laid out. But it needs dates on your Issues to work, which we'll explore later."

**[Slide 10: When to Use Each View]**

> "Here's the simple version: Board for daily work. Table for details and sorting. Timeline for seasonal planning. And the great part — you can have all three views of the same Project. Same data, different angles."

**Turn and Talk (2 minutes):**

> "Before we move on, turn to your partner. Which of these three views — Board, Table, or Timeline — would be most useful on your farm? Why? You have 2 minutes."

*Let pairs discuss. Ask 1-2 volunteers to share. This breaks up the concept-heavy section and re-engages learners.*

*Check for understanding:* "Quick check — if you wanted to see all tasks assigned to one person, which view would you use?" (Table — sort by Assignee)

---

### 0:30–0:45 — Live Demo (15 min)

**[Slide 15: Live Demo]**

> "Now I'm going to build a project board right in front of you. Watch the steps — you'll do this yourself in a few minutes."

**Demo Steps:**

1. **Create Project:**
   > "I'm clicking the 'Projects' tab... then 'New project'... I'll choose 'Board'... and name it 'Spring Planting 2026.' Click 'Create.'"

   *Point to the empty board.* "See the three columns? Todo, In Progress, Done."

2. **Add Issues:**
   > "Now I'll add some Issues. Click '+ Add item' at the bottom of the Todo column... type '#' to search... here's 'Prepare Field 1 for corn.' Click it."

   *Add 3-4 Issues. Name each one aloud.*

3. **Move a card (two methods):**
   > "Let's say I started working on the corn field. There are two ways to move it.
   >
   > **Method 1 — Dropdown:** I click the card, then find the Status dropdown on the right side of the page, and change it to 'In Progress.' This always works, even on touchpads.
   >
   > **Method 2 — Drag:** I can also click and hold the card... and drag it to the 'In Progress' column. See how it moved? Same result, just a different way."

   *Show the dropdown method FIRST — it's the reliable fallback. Then show drag-and-drop as the quicker option.*

4. **Add custom column:**
   > "What if I need a column for tasks that are waiting on weather? Click the '+' next to the last column... type 'Waiting on Weather'... and I can drag a card there."

5. **Switch views:**
   > "Now let's see the same data differently. I'll click here to switch to Table View..."

   *Show Table View.* "Same Issues, but now in rows. I can sort by clicking column headers."

   *Switch to Timeline View.* "And Timeline View shows dates — but notice some Issues don't appear because they don't have dates set yet. We'll learn more about that in Session 9."

*Switch back to Board View.*

> "Questions before you try it yourselves?"

---

### 0:45–1:05 — Guided Practice (20 min)

**[Slide 16-17: Guided Practice]**

> "Your turn! Follow along with me step by step."

*Distribute lab exercise handouts.*

> "Find Part 1 on your handout — Guided Practice. We're going to do exactly what I just showed you."

**Walk through each step on the projector while learners follow along:**

1. > "Step 1: Go to the demo repository. Click the 'Projects' tab at the top."
   *Pause. Check screens.* "Everyone see the Projects tab?"

2. > "Click 'New project.' Choose 'Board.' Name it '[Your Name]'s Farm Plan.' Click 'Create.'"
   *Pause.* "Raise your hand when you see an empty board."

3. > "Now click '+ Add item' in the Todo column. Type '#' and pick an Issue. Do this 3 times."
   *Walk the room. Help anyone stuck.*

4. > "Now drag one card to 'In Progress.'"
   *Pause.* "You should see 2 cards in Todo and 1 in In Progress."

**Checkpoint:** "Raise your hand when your board has 3 cards — 2 in Todo and 1 in In Progress."

*Help any learners who are stuck. Common issues:*
- Can't find Projects tab → It's between "Pull requests" and "Actions"
- Add item doesn't work → Make sure they type # to search
- Can't drag → Click and hold for a moment, then drag

> "Great work! You just created your first project board."

---

### 1:05–1:20 — BREAK (15 min)

**[Slide 18: Break]**

> "Take 15 minutes. When we come back, you'll build a complete project board from scratch — your choice of scenario."

---

### 1:20–1:50 — Independent Practice (30 min)

**[Slide 19: Independent Practice]**

> "Now you're going to build a complete project board on your own. Look at Part 2 of your handout — Independent Practice."

> "You have three scenarios to choose from: Spring Planting, Equipment Maintenance, or Livestock Health. Pick whichever fits your farm best."

> "Your goal: Create a Project, add 4 Issues, organize them across columns, add a custom column, and explore Table View. The checklist is on your handout."

*Set a timer for 25 minutes. Walk the room constantly.*

**Common support needs:**
- Some learners will finish quickly → Encourage them to try Timeline View or help their partner
- Some will struggle with drag-and-drop → Remind them of the dropdown method (click the card → Status dropdown on the right side → change column). This was taught during the demo.
- Learner finishes early → Encourage them to try Timeline View, help their partner, or explore filtering by label
- Some may not know what Issues to create → Suggest titles from the scenario table

**L2 Observation Checklist (note during walkabout):**
- [ ] Can create a new Project independently
- [ ] Can add Issues to a Project board
- [ ] Can move cards between columns
- [ ] Can add a custom column
- [ ] Can switch between Board and Table views
- [ ] Understands the purpose of each view

*At 5 minutes remaining:* "Five more minutes! Make sure you've tried switching to Table View."

---

### 1:50–2:00 — Vocabulary & Reflection (10 min)

**[Slide 20: Key Vocabulary]**

> "Let's review the new terms from today."

*Go through each term. Ask a learner to explain in their own words:*
- "Who can tell me what a Project is in their own words?"
- "What's the difference between Board View and Table View?"
- "When would you use Timeline View?"

**[Slide 21: Reflection]**

> "Think about YOUR farm. What 3 tasks would you put on a project board? Which view would be most useful?"

> "Turn to your partner and share. You have 3 minutes."

*Walk around and listen. Note which views generate the most interest.*

---

### 2:00–2:10 — Wrap-Up (10 min)

**[Slide 22: What's Next]**

> "Next session, we'll learn about collaboration — how to share your farm plans with others and work together on shared documents. Think of it like passing a notebook back and forth, but everyone can see the changes."

> "Before next session, try adding a couple more Issues to your project board and moving cards as you complete tasks. The more you use it, the more natural it gets."

**[Slide 23: Feedback Survey]**

> "Please fill out the quick survey before you leave. Your feedback helps me make these sessions better."

> "Thank you! You now know how to plan and organize your farm tasks visually on GitHub. See you next time!"

## Emergency Procedures

**Internet goes down:**
- Use printed screenshots of each view type to continue the concept introduction
- Have learners sketch their project board on paper (columns: Todo, In Progress, Done)
- Continue with vocabulary and reflection using printed materials

**Projector fails:**
- Walk around and demonstrate on individual screens
- Pair experienced learners with those who need more help
- Use the printed lab exercise as the primary guide

**GitHub is slow or unresponsive:**
- Reduce the number of Issues from 4 to 2
- Skip Timeline View exploration
- Focus on Board View only — the most intuitive view

**Learner finishes early:**
- Try adding custom fields (due date, priority)
- Create a second Project with a different view
- Help a neighboring learner
- Explore filtering cards by label
