## Part 1: Guided Practice (15 minutes)

**Follow along with the instructor.**

### Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click the **"Projects"** tab at the top of the page
3. Click the green **"New project"** button
4. Select **"Board"** as the layout
5. Name your project: **"[Your Name]'s Farm Plan"**
6. Click **"Create"**

**What you should see:** An empty board with columns: "Todo," "In Progress," and "Done."

### Step 2: Add Issues to Your Board

1. In the **"Todo"** column, click **"+ Add item"** at the bottom
2. Type **#** to search for existing Issues
3. Select an Issue (e.g., "Fix broken fence post — north pasture")
4. Repeat to add **2 more Issues** to the Todo column

**What you should see:** 3 cards in the "Todo" column.

### Step 3: Move a Card

1. Click and hold on one of the cards in "Todo"
2. Drag it to the **"In Progress"** column
3. Release the card

**What you should see:** 2 cards in "Todo" and 1 card in "In Progress."

- [ ] I added 3 Issues as cards
- [ ] I moved 1 card to "In Progress"

## Part 2: Independent Practice (25 minutes)

**Choose your scenario and build a complete project board.**

### Choose Your Scenario

| Scenario | Issues to Create |
|----------|-----------------|
| **A: Spring Planting** | "Prepare Field 1 for corn," "Order soybean seeds," "Test soil in Field 3," "Schedule irrigation setup" |
| **B: Equipment Maintenance** | "Tractor 500-hour service," "Replace combine belt," "Sharpen mower blades," "Check irrigation pump" |
| **C: Livestock Health** | "Schedule Herd A vaccinations," "Order mineral supplements," "Repair water trough — east pasture," "Update health records" |

### Your Tasks

1. **Create a new Project** with a name matching your scenario
   - Example: "Spring Planting 2026" or "Equipment Schedule Q2"

2. **Create 4 new Issues** in the demo repository
   - Use the titles from your scenario (or make up your own!)
   - Add a label to each Issue (crops, equipment, livestock, etc.)

3. **Add all 4 Issues to your Project board**

4. **Organize your board:**
   - Move 1 Issue to **"In Progress"**
   - Move 1 Issue to **"Done"**
   - Leave 2 in **"Todo"**

5. **Add a custom column:**
   - Click **"+"** next to the last column
   - Name it something useful for your scenario:
     - Planting: "Waiting on Weather"
     - Equipment: "Waiting on Parts"
     - Livestock: "Waiting on Vet"
   - Move 1 Issue to your new column

6. **Explore Table View:**
   - Click the **dropdown arrow** next to your view name
   - Select **"Table"**
   - Notice how the same Issues appear as rows
   - Try clicking a column header to sort

7. **Explore Timeline View (bonus):**
   - Switch to **"Timeline"** view
   - Notice: Issues need start/end dates to appear on the timeline
   - Add a date field to one Issue if time permits

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] Created a new Project with a descriptive name
- [ ] Created and added 4 Issues to the board
- [ ] Moved Issues to show different statuses (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- [ ] Added 1 custom column with a relevant name
- [ ] Switched to Table View and explored sorting
- [ ] (Bonus) Switched to Timeline View

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find the Projects tab | Look at the top of the repository page, between "Pull requests" and "Actions" |
| "Add item" doesn't find my Issue | Make sure the Issue is in the same repository. Try typing the full title. |
| Can't drag a card | Click and hold for a moment before dragging. Try a different browser if it doesn't work. |
| Board looks empty | Click "Todo" column — cards might be collapsed. Check that you added Issues to THIS project. |
| Table View looks different | That's expected — it shows the same data in spreadsheet format. All your Issues are still there. |
| Timeline is blank | Issues need start and end date fields. Ask the instructor for help adding dates. |

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, discuss with your partner:

1. Which view (Board, Table, or Timeline) do you think would be most useful on your farm?
2. What columns would you create for your real farm project board?
3. How would a shared project board help your farm team communicate?
