### Slide 1 — Title

**GitHub Projects for Planning**
*Organizing Your Farm Season — Like a Whiteboard for Your Farm*

Session 3 of 12 — GitHub Training for Farmers

---

### Slide 2 — Welcome Back

**Welcome to Session 3!**

In Session 1, you learned to navigate a repository — your digital barn.
In Session 2, you created Issues — your digital work orders.

Today you'll learn to organize those Issues into a **Project** — your digital planning board.

By the end of today, you will have built a project board for your farm season.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

How do you plan your farm season right now?

- A wall calendar?
- A whiteboard?
- Notebook and pen?
- Keeping it all in your head?

*What happens when plans change mid-season?*

> Instructor note: Let 2-3 learners answer. "Has anyone ever lost track of what's been done and what's still pending?"

---

### Slide 4 — The Problem

**Farm planning is scattered.**

- Tasks live in different places (notebooks, texts, memory)
- No single view of everything that needs doing
- Hard to see who's working on what
- When weather changes plans, updating everything is painful
- No way to see if you're on track for the season

**What if you had one board showing every task, who's doing it, and what's done?**

---

### Slide 5 — What Is a GitHub Project?

**Project = Your Digital Planning Board**

A GitHub Project is a tool that organizes your Issues into a visual layout.

Think of it like:
- A **whiteboard** with sticky notes you can move around
- A **planting calendar** you can rearrange when plans change
- A **task board** the whole team can see

You already know how to create Issues. Projects let you **see them all at once** and organize them.

---

### Slide 6 — Three Ways to View Your Project

**GitHub Projects has 3 views — pick the one that fits your need.**

- **Board View** — Columns like a whiteboard. Drag tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Table View** — Rows and columns like a spreadsheet. Sort, filter, and add custom fields (extra columns you create yourself, like "Due Date").
- **Timeline View** — A calendar showing when tasks start and end. See your whole season at a glance.

You can switch between views anytime — same data, different way to look at it.

---

### Slide 7 — Board View: Your Task Whiteboard

**Board View organizes tasks into columns.**

Each column represents a status:
- **To Do** — Work that hasn't started
- **In Progress** — Work someone is doing now
- **Done** — Completed tasks

To move a task: **drag the card** from one column to the next.

It's like moving a sticky note on a whiteboard from "Needs Doing" to "Finished."

> Instructor note: This is the view most farmers find intuitive. Start here.

---

### Slide 8 — Table View: Your Spreadsheet

**Table View shows tasks in rows — like a spreadsheet.**

Each row is one Issue. Columns show details:
- Title
- Status
- Assignee
- Labels
- Due date (a custom field — one you add yourself)

You can **sort** by any column and **filter** to show only certain tasks.

Best for: Seeing lots of details at once, sorting by date or person.

---

### Slide 9 — Timeline View: Your Season Calendar

**Timeline View shows tasks on a calendar.**

Each task is a bar showing when it starts and ends.

You can see:
- Which tasks overlap
- What's coming up next
- How the whole season looks

Best for: **Planting schedules**, seasonal planning, seeing the big picture.

> Instructor note: Timeline requires start and end dates on Issues. Show how to add these.

---

### Slide 10 — When to Use Each View

**Choose the view that fits your question:**

- **"What needs doing today?"** — Board View
- **"What's everyone working on?"** — Table View (filter by assignee)
- **"When do I plant each field?"** — Timeline View

You can create **multiple views** of the same Project — one Board, one Timeline, one Table. Switch between them with tabs.

---

### Slide 11 — Creating a Project: Step by Step

**How to create a new Project:**

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the **"Projects"** tab (near the top)
3. Click **"New project"**
4. Choose **Board** layout (easiest to start with)
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Spring 2026 Farm Plan")
6. Click **"Create"**

That's it — you have a planning board!

> Instructor note: Walk through each step on the projector.

---

### Slide 12 — Adding Issues to Your Project

**Your Project board starts empty. Let's add Issues to it.**

Two ways to add Issues:
- **From the Project:** Click **"+ Add item"** at the bottom of any column. Search for an existing Issue or type a new one.
- **From an Issue:** Open any Issue, look at the right sidebar, click **"Projects"**, and select your project.

Each Issue becomes a **card** on your board.

---

### Slide 13 — Moving Cards on the Board

**To update a task's status, drag the card.**

- Task started? Drag from **"To Do"** to **"In Progress"**
- Task finished? Drag to **"Done"**

Everyone with access can see the current status instantly.

It's like moving a sticky note across a whiteboard — but everyone can see it from anywhere.

> Instructor note: Demonstrate dragging 2-3 cards. Let learners see the animation.

---

### Slide 14 — Adding Custom Columns

**You can rename columns or add new ones.**

Default columns: To Do, In Progress, Done

Farm-friendly columns you might add:
- **Waiting on Weather**
- **Waiting on Parts**
- **Needs Supplies**
- **Scheduled This Week**

Click **"+"** next to the last column to add a new one. Click a column name to rename it.

---

### Slide 15 — Live Demo: Building a Farm Project Board

**Watch me build a spring planting project.**

I'm going to:
1. Create a new Project called "Spring Planting 2026"
2. Add 4 Issues (one for each field)
3. Drag 1 Issue to "In Progress"
4. Add a custom column: "Waiting on Weather"
5. Switch to Table View and Timeline View

**Just watch for now — you'll build your own next.**

> Instructor note: Use the demo farm repository. Create Issues ahead of time if not already present. Show all 3 views.

---

### Slide 16 — Guided Practice Introduction

**Your turn! Follow along with me.**

You and your partner will create a farm Project board together.

I'll walk you through each step. Follow along on your screen.

If you get stuck:
1. Ask your partner
2. Raise your hand — I'll come to you

**You can't break anything. If something goes wrong, we'll fix it together.**

> Instructor note: Pair learners. Distribute the lab exercise handout.

---

### Slide 17 — Guided Practice Steps

**Follow along with me:**

1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click the **"Projects"** tab
3. Click **"New project"** → choose **Board**
4. Name it: **"[Your Name]'s Farm Plan"**
5. Click **"Create"**
6. Add 3 Issues to your board using **"+ Add item"**
7. Drag 1 Issue to **"In Progress"**

**Checkpoint:** You should see 3 cards on your board — 2 in "To Do" and 1 in "In Progress."

> Instructor note: Pause at checkpoint. "Raise your hand when you see 3 cards on your board."

---

### Slide 18 — BREAK (15 Minutes)

**Take 15 minutes.**

When we come back, you'll build your own farm project board from scratch!

---

### Slide 19 — Independent Practice

**Your challenge: Build a complete farm project board.**

Choose your scenario:
- **Option A:** Spring Planting — create Issues for 4 fields
- **Option B:** Equipment Maintenance — create Issues for 4 machines
- **Option C:** Livestock Health — create Issues for 4 animal groups

For your project board:
1. Create a new Project with a descriptive name
2. Add at least 4 Issues
3. Move at least 1 to "In Progress" and 1 to "Done"
4. Add 1 custom column
5. Switch to Table View — what do you notice?

---

### Slide 20 — Key Vocabulary Review

**New terms from today:**

- **Project** — A planning board that organizes Issues visually
- **Board View** — Columns layout (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Table View** — Spreadsheet layout with sortable columns
- **Timeline View** — Calendar layout showing start/end dates
- **Card** — An Issue displayed on a project board
- **Custom Column** — A column you create for your workflow

---

### Slide 21 — Reflection

**Think about your farm:**

What are 3 tasks you would organize into a Project board?
Which view (Board, Table, or Timeline) would be most useful for your farm?

**Turn to your partner and share your answers. (3 minutes)**

> Instructor note: Walk around and listen. Note which views spark the most interest — this informs Session 9 (Advanced Projects).

---

### Slide 22 — What's Next

**Session 4: Collaboration & Pull Requests**

Learn to share your farm plans with others and work together — like passing a notebook back and forth, but everyone can see the changes.

**Optional between-session practice:**
- Add 2 more Issues to your project board
- Try switching between Board, Table, and Timeline views
- Move cards as you complete tasks this week

---

### Slide 23 — Feedback Survey
