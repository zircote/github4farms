## Three Ways to View Your Project

| View | Best For | How It Looks |

| **Board** | Daily task tracking | Columns with draggable cards |
| **Table** | Sorting and filtering details | Spreadsheet rows and columns |
| **Timeline** | Seasonal planning | Calendar with date bars |

**To switch views:** Click the dropdown arrow next to your current view name, or click the **"+"** tab to add a new view.

## When to Use Each View

- **"What needs doing today?"** → Board View
- **"What's everyone working on?"** → Table View (sort by Assignee)
- **"When does each task happen?"** → Timeline View
- **"What's overdue?"** → Table View (sort by Due Date)

## Key Terms

## Tips

- **Start simple.** Use Board View with 3-4 columns. Add complexity later.
- **Check your board daily.** Move cards as you start and finish tasks.
- **Use labels.** They help you filter your board (e.g., show only "equipment" tasks).
- **Share with your team.** Everyone with repository access can see and update the board.
