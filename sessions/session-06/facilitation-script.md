## Phase 1: Welcome & Hook (10 min) — 0:00

**Facilitation Script:**

> "Good [morning/afternoon]. Welcome to Session 6. Quick question for you."

> "How many of you create the same kind of task over and over on your farm? Maybe a weekly equipment check, a seasonal planting task, or a maintenance request? Raise your hand if you've written basically the same thing more than once."

*Most hands should go up.*

> "And when you write it from scratch each time, do you ever forget to include something important? Like the location, or the urgency, or what you already tried?"

> "Today we're going to solve that. You're going to build **templates** — pre-filled forms that have all the right sections already set up. It's like having a pre-printed work order form at the farm office. You fill in the blanks instead of starting from scratch."

> "By the end of today, you'll have created reusable templates for your farm's most common tasks."

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] Open with a question about repetitive tasks
- [ ] Share the "pre-printed work order form" analogy
- [ ] State the outcome in plain language
- [ ] Connect to prior sessions: "You've been creating Issues since Session 2. Templates make that faster and more consistent."

## Phase 2: Concrete Experience — Instructor Demo (20 min) — 0:10

**"I Do" — Watch Me Create a Template and Use It**

> "I'm going to show you three things: how to create an Issue Template, how to use it, and how to create a Saved Reply. Just watch."

### Demo 1: The "Before" — Creating an Issue Without a Template (3 min)

> "First, let me show you what happens without a template."

1. Go to the demo repository → Issues → New Issue
2. Show the blank page

> "Nothing to guide me. If I'm tired or in a hurry, I might write something like: 'Tractor problem.' That's not helpful to anyone. What tractor? What problem? How urgent?"

> "Now let me show you what happens with a template."

### Demo 2: Create an Issue Template (10 min)

> "I'm going to create a template for equipment maintenance requests."

1. Go to the instructor's repository → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Features** → click **"Set up templates"**

> "This is where templates live. Let me add one."

3. Click **"Add template"** → **"Custom template"**
4. Click the pencil icon to edit

> "I need to give it a name, a short description, and then the actual form content."

5. Fill in:
   - Template name: "Equipment Maintenance Request"
   - About: "Use this template to report equipment issues or request maintenance."
   - Content: Paste the equipment template from Slide 11

> "Notice the sections: Equipment Information, Problem Description, Urgency checkboxes, Steps Already Taken, and a Checklist. This is everything I need someone to tell me when something breaks."

6. Click **"Propose changes"** → **"Commit changes"**

> "The template is saved. Now let me show you what it looks like when someone creates an Issue."

### Demo 3: Use the Template (4 min)

1. Go to Issues → **New Issue**

> "See this? Instead of a blank page, I get a choice. I can pick 'Equipment Maintenance Request' or just open a blank Issue."

2. Click **"Get started"** next to the template

> "Look — all the sections are already there. I just fill in the blanks."

3. Fill in quickly: John Deere 6120M, engine stalls, medium urgency
4. Click **Submit new issue**

> "Compare this to 'Tractor problem.' Night and day."

### Demo 4: Create a Saved Reply (3 min)

> "One more thing. If you find yourself typing the same comment over and over — like 'Parts ordered, will update when delivered' — you can save it."

1. Click profile → Settings → Saved replies
2. Click **"Add a saved reply"**
3. Title: "Parts ordered"
4. Text: "Parts ordered. Expected delivery: [date]. Will update when they arrive."
5. Click **"Add saved reply"**

> "Now let me use it."

6. Go back to the Issue, click in the comment box
7. Click the **arrow icon** in the toolbar
8. Select "Parts ordered"

> "It fills in automatically. I just change the date and post. No retyping."

9. Edit the date and click **Comment**

---

## Phase 3: Reflective Observation — Guided Practice (20 min) — 0:30

**"We Do" — Create a Template Together**

> "Now it's your turn. You're going to create the same equipment maintenance template on your own repository. I'll walk you through each step."

> "Important: you need to be on a repository you own — not the shared demo repository. If you don't have one, I'll help you create one quickly."

*Distribute lab exercise handouts.*

**Help learners who need a repository (3 min):**

> "If you need to create a repository: click the + icon in the top right, click New repository, name it 'my-farm', check 'Add a README file', and click Create repository."

**Walk through template creation (12 min):**

1. "Go to your repository. Click Settings."
   - Pause: "Raise your hand when you see the Settings page."

2. "Scroll down to Features. Click 'Set up templates' next to Issues."
   - Pause: "Raise your hand when you see the Issue templates page."

3. "Click Add template, then Custom template. Click the pencil icon to edit."

4. "Fill in the name: 'Equipment Maintenance Request.' Copy the template content from your handout."
   - Circulate and help with copy/paste. Some learners may need to type it.
   - "Don't worry about getting it perfect — you can always edit it later."

5. "Click Propose changes, then Commit changes."

**Test the template (5 min):**

6. "Now go to your Issues tab. Click New Issue. Do you see your template?"
   - Pause: "Raise your hand when you see 'Equipment Maintenance Request' in the template chooser."

7. "Click Get started. Fill in the blanks with a tractor scenario. Click Submit."

**Checkpoint:** "You should now have one Issue created from your template."

**Troubleshooting During Guided Practice:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find Settings | Check you're on your own repo (your username in URL). The shared demo repo won't show Settings |
| "Set up templates" not visible | Scroll further down in Settings — it's in the Features section |
| Template not appearing after commit | Go back to Issues → New Issue. Refresh the page if needed |
| Template content formatting looks wrong | Check Markdown syntax — checklists need `- [ ]` with exact spacing |

---

## Phase 4: Abstract Conceptualization (20 min) — 0:50

**"Now Let's Understand How to Design Good Templates"**

> "You just created a template. Now let's talk about what makes a template useful vs. what makes one that nobody uses."

### Concept 1: What Makes a Good Template (8 min)

> "A good template has three things:"

1. **Clear sections** — Guide the person through what information to provide

> "Instead of 'Describe the problem,' write 'Equipment name: ___ / Location: ___ / What's wrong: ___'. Specific prompts get specific answers."

2. **Urgency levels** — Help prioritize

> "Checkboxes work great: Emergency / High / Medium / Low. The person picks one, and you know how fast to respond."

3. **Completion checklist** — Track progress

> "A checklist at the bottom — photo attached, parts identified, repair completed — turns the Issue into a workflow, not just a report."

### Concept 2: When to Use Each Template Type (5 min)

Show the comparison table (Slide 16):

> "Issue Templates are for tasks you create repeatedly. Saved Replies are for comments you type repeatedly. Project Templates are for board structures you reuse — we'll cover those in Session 9."

> "Start with Issue Templates — they save the most time."

### Turn and Talk (5 min)

> "Turn to your partner. Think about your farm and answer these questions — you have 3 minutes:"

1. "What are the 3 most common tasks you create repeatedly?"
2. "For each one, what sections would your template need?"

*After 3 minutes, ask 2-3 pairs to share.*

### Concept 3: Templates as Farm Knowledge (2 min)

> "Here's something powerful about templates: they capture your expertise. If you build a good equipment maintenance template, anyone on your farm — even someone on their first day — can create a proper, complete report. Your knowledge is built into the form."

> "Templates don't just save time. They preserve quality."

---

## BREAK (15 min) — 1:10

> "Take 15 minutes. Stretch, grab a drink, ask me any questions. We'll start back at [time]."

**During break:**
- [ ] Help anyone who had trouble creating their first template
- [ ] Check that all learners have a working repository with Settings access
- [ ] Note any widespread confusion for post-break review

---

## Phase 5: Active Experimentation — Independent Practice (35 min) — 1:25

**"You Do" — Design Your Own Farm Templates**

> "Now you're going to design templates for your own farm. Your handout has six template options to choose from — pick 2 that match your farm. Or design your own from scratch."

> "You'll also create 2 more Saved Replies and test everything by creating real Issues."

> "Work through Tasks 1, 2, and 3 on your handout. If you finish early, check the stretch challenges."

**Circulate and observe. Use the L2 checklist to note:**
- [ ] Can navigate to Settings → Issue Templates
- [ ] Can design template with guided sections and checklists
- [ ] Can create a Saved Reply
- [ ] Can test a template by creating an Issue with it

**For early finishers:**
> "Check the stretch challenges — try adding default labels to your templates, or help a classmate design a template for their specific farm."

**Common issues during independent practice:**
- **Learners stuck on template content:** "Think about the last time you dealt with this type of task. What questions did you wish you had answers to? Those are your template sections."
- **Markdown checklist formatting:** "It's dash, space, open bracket, space, close bracket, space, then the text: `- [ ] Item`. The spaces matter."
- **Templates not saving:** "Make sure you click Propose changes and then Commit changes — both steps are needed."

## Phase 6: Reflection (10 min) — 2:00

> "Let's think about what you built today."

**Partner Share (5 min):**

> "Turn to your partner. Share your answers:"
> 1. "Which template will be most useful on your farm?"
> 2. "Who else on your farm would benefit from using your templates?"

**Whole Group (5 min):**

> "Who'd like to share what templates they created?"

*Take 2-3 volunteers. Celebrate creative designs:*
> "I saw [Name] create a livestock health template that includes follow-up scheduling — that's really thoughtful design. It turns a report into a workflow."

> "The templates you built today will save you time every single week. And they make sure important details never get forgotten."

---

## Phase 7: Wrap-Up (10 min) — 2:10

> "Great work today. Here's what we covered:"

1. **Issue Templates** — pre-filled forms for common farm tasks
2. **Saved Replies** — reusable comments for frequent responses
3. **Template design** — clear sections, urgency levels, and checklists
4. **Templates as knowledge** — capturing your expertise in a form anyone can use

> "Next session — **Session 7: Introduction to GitHub Actions** — you'll learn how GitHub can **automatically do things for you**. Imagine getting a reminder when an equipment check is overdue, or a notification when a deadline is approaching — without anyone having to remember to send it. No coding required."

> "Optional practice before next time: create more templates, use your templates to create a few real Issues, and think about what farm tasks you'd like to automate."

> "Please fill out the feedback survey before you leave."

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] Summarize 4 key concepts
- [ ] Preview Session 7 and connection to today (templates → automation)
- [ ] Distribute feedback survey
- [ ] Mention optional practice
- [ ] Thank learners

---

## Phase 8: Buffer (10 min) — 2:20

- [ ] Help any learner who didn't complete the exercise
- [ ] Collect remaining feedback surveys
- [ ] Note learners who may need extra support
- [ ] Answer remaining questions
