# Facilitation Script: Session 9 — Advanced Projects & Roadmaps

> **Duration:** 165 minutes (2 hours 45 minutes; includes 15-minute buffer)
> **Bloom's Level:** Analyze / Evaluate
> **Practice Time:** 92 minutes (Guided 20 + Independent 35 + Reflection activities 10 + Demo follow-along 12 + Evaluation share 15) = ~56%
> **Prerequisites:** Sessions 1-8 (GitHub account, repository, Issues, Projects basics, Pull Requests, notifications, templates, YAML, Actions)
> **Key Analogies:** Custom fields = Extra columns in your farm ledger; Iterations = Chapters of your farm year; Timeline view = Climbing the water tower to see all your fields; Cross-repo linking = One master planning board for the whole farm; Evaluating a roadmap = Walking the fence line before the season starts

## Phase 1: Welcome & Hook (10 min) — 0:00

**[Slide 1-2: Title, Welcome Back]**

> "Good [morning/afternoon]. Welcome to Session 9. Today is a big one. We're going to take everything you've learned about Projects and Issues and turn it into something you can actually use to plan your entire farm season."

> "Over the past eight sessions, you've tracked tasks, organized boards, built templates, and even automated reminders. All of that is powerful — but it's like looking at your farm one field at a time. Today, we're climbing the water tower. You're going to see your whole season on one screen."

**[Slide 3: Why This Matters for YOUR Farm]**

> "Let me ask you this: Right now, how do you see your whole farm season at once? A wall calendar? A planner book? A spreadsheet? Or is it mostly in your head?"

*Pause. Let 3-4 learners answer. Write their methods on the whiteboard.*

> "Every one of those works — to a point. But what happens when the weather changes your planting window? Or the combine needs service the same week you planned to harvest? Or you realize you forgot to order seed two weeks before planting?"

> "A roadmap shows you all of that at once. You can see where tasks overlap, where there are gaps, and where you've got a problem before it becomes an emergency. That's what we're building today — a seasonal roadmap for your farm."

---

## Phase 2: Quick Review (5 min) — 0:10

**[Slide 4: From Board View to Roadmap View]**

> "Quick refresher from Session 3. Who remembers what a Board view is?"

*Wait for a learner to answer. Reinforce:*

> "Right — columns like To Do, In Progress, Done. It's a whiteboard for daily work. And Table view is like a spreadsheet — rows of Issues with columns for details."

> "Those are great for day-to-day work. But they don't answer the question: 'What does my whole season look like?' They don't show you WHEN things happen across months. Today we're adding three new tools to your Project: custom fields, iterations, and the Timeline view. Together, these turn a task list into a seasonal plan."

---

## Phase 3: Concrete Experience — Live Demo (15 min) — 0:15

**[Slide 5-6: Custom Fields]**

> "Let me show you how this works. Watch my screen."

*Switch to the browser. Open the demo Project with 10-15 pre-created Issues in Table view.*

> "I've got my farm Project open with a bunch of Issues — planting tasks, equipment service, some harvest planning. Right now it's just a list of titles and statuses. I want to add more detail."

> "First, I'm going to add a custom field. Think of this like adding a new column to a paper ledger."

*Click the "+" at the far right of the column headers. Click "New field."*

> "I'll call this one 'Crop Type' and make it a 'Single select' — that's a dropdown list. Now I'll add my options: Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Alfalfa."

*Add the options, click Save. The new column appears.*

> "There it is — a new column. Now I can click each Issue and pick a crop type from the dropdown."

*Fill in 4-5 Issues with crop types.*

> "Let me add two more fields. A Date field called 'Target Date' — so I can put a calendar date on each task."

*Create the date field. Fill in dates for 5-6 Issues, spread across March through October.*

> "And a Number field called 'Acres' — so I can track how many acres each task covers."

*Create the number field. Fill in 3-4 Issues.*

**[Slide 7-8: Iterations]**

> "Now I'm going to create iterations — time blocks for my season. Think of these like chapters in your farm year."

*Click "+", select "Iteration" type, name it "Season Phase."*

> "I'll set up four iterations: Spring Planting starting March 15 for 6 weeks, Growing Season starting May 1 for 10 weeks, Harvest starting July 15 for 8 weeks, and Fall Prep starting September 15 for 8 weeks."

*Create the iterations. Assign 4-5 Issues to iterations.*

**[Slide 9-10: Timeline View]**

> "Now the exciting part. I'm going to switch to Timeline view."

*Click the "+" next to the view tabs. Select "Roadmap."*

> "Look at that."

*Pause for 5 seconds. Let the visual sink in.*

> "Every Issue is a bar on a calendar. I can see March through October on one screen. I can see where tasks cluster, where there are gaps, and — look here — these two bars overlap. My tractor service is scheduled for the same week as spring planting. That's a problem I wouldn't have seen in a list view."

*Point out the overlap on screen.*

> "I can drag this bar to move the tractor service to the week before planting. Problem solved — before the season even started."

*Drag the bar to demonstrate.*

**[Slide 11: Cross-Repository Linking]**

> "One more thing. I've got a separate equipment repository with some maintenance Issues. Let me add one to this Project."

*Click "Add item" at the bottom. Type "#" and the equipment repo name. Select an Issue and add it.*

> "Now my seasonal roadmap shows crops AND equipment in one place. One master board for the whole farm."

*Point to the newly added Issue on the Timeline.*

> "That's the full picture. Custom fields give you detail. Iterations give you time blocks. Timeline view gives you the bird's-eye view. And cross-repo linking gives you everything in one place."

---

## Phase 4: Reflective Observation — Guided Practice (20 min) — 0:30

**[Slide 16: Guided Practice Introduction]**

> "Your turn! We're going to do this together, step by step. Open your lab exercise handout to Part 1: Guided Practice."

*Distribute handouts if not already done.*

> "Everyone, open your Project from Session 3. If you don't have one, follow Step 1 on the handout to create a new one. Raise your hand if you need help finding it."

*Wait. Help anyone who can't find their Project.*

> "If your Project has fewer than 5 Issues, follow Step 2 on the handout to add some. We need at least 5-6 Issues to build a meaningful roadmap."

*Wait 2-3 minutes for learners who need to add Issues.*

> "Now we're going to add our first custom field. Everyone look at the top of your Table view — see the column headers? At the far right, there's a '+' button. Click it."

*Wait for everyone.*

> "Click 'New field.' Name it 'Target Date.' For the field type, choose 'Date.' Click Save."

*Walk around and verify.*

> "You should see a new column called Target Date. Click in that cell for your first Issue and pick a date. Space your dates across different months — March, April, May, June, and so on."

*Allow 2 minutes for learners to fill in dates.*

> "Great. Now add a second custom field — click the '+' again. Name this one 'Category.' Field type: 'Single select.' Add these options: Crops, Equipment, Livestock, Infrastructure. Click Save."

*Wait. Walk around.*

> "Fill in the Category for each Issue. Pick whichever fits."

*Allow 1-2 minutes.*

> "Last field — click '+' once more. Name it 'Acres.' Field type: 'Number.' Click Save. Fill in a number for any Issue where acreage makes sense."

*Wait. Walk around.*

> "Now the fun part — iterations. Click the '+' to add one more new field. Name it 'Season Phase.' This time, select 'Iteration' as the field type."

*Walk around. This step may be unfamiliar — check every screen.*

> "Set the start date for your first iteration — use something like March 15. Duration: 6 weeks. Save it. Then edit the field to add more iterations. Try to create at least 3 time blocks — Spring Planting, Growing Season, and Harvest, for example."

*Allow 3-4 minutes. Help learners who get stuck on iteration setup.*

> "Now assign your Issues to iterations. Click the Season Phase cell for each Issue and pick the right time block."

*Allow 2 minutes.*

> "And now — the moment of truth. Click the '+' next to your view tabs at the top. Select 'Roadmap.' Choose your Target Date field when it asks."

*Wait. Scan the room.*

> "What do you see?"

*Let a few learners react.*

> "You're looking at your farm season on one screen. Scroll left and right to see different months. Zoom in and out. Click on any bar to see the Issue details."

### Guided Practice Checkpoint

> "Let me see a show of hands. Who has:"
> - "A Date field with dates filled in for at least 4 Issues?" *Count hands.*
> - "A Category dropdown field?" *Count hands.*
> - "A Number field?" *Count hands.*
> - "At least 3 iterations set up?" *Count hands.*
> - "The Timeline view open, showing their Issues on a calendar?" *Count hands.*

> "Outstanding. You've just built a seasonal roadmap. Now let's learn how to evaluate it."

---

## Phase 5: Abstract Conceptualization — Evaluation Concepts (10 min) — 0:50

**[Slide 13-14: Evaluating Your Roadmap]**

> "Building the roadmap is step one. The real value comes from evaluating it — looking at it critically and asking: 'Is this plan actually going to work?'"

> "There are three things to look for."

> "First — scheduling conflicts. That's when two tasks need the same resource at the same time. Think of it like trying to be in two fields at once. On your roadmap, look for bars that overlap when they shouldn't."

> "Second — resource bottlenecks. That's when one person, one machine, or one supply is stretched too thin during a specific period. If you've got three equipment repairs all in the same week, your mechanic becomes a bottleneck."

> "Third — missing dependencies. That's when Task B can't start until Task A is done, but Task A isn't even on the schedule. If you're planting corn next month but you haven't ordered seed yet, that's a missing dependency."

*Show the evaluation examples table on the slide. Walk through 2-3 rows.*

> "Has anyone experienced one of these on their farm? Where you realized too late that two things needed the same equipment, or you forgot to order something in time?"

*Let 2-3 learners share. Acknowledge each one.*

> "That's exactly what a roadmap helps you catch — in January, not during planting season. When we come back from break, you'll build a complete roadmap and practice finding these problems."

---

## BREAK (15 min) — 1:00

**[Slide 17: Break]**

> "Take 15 minutes. When we come back, you'll build a full seasonal roadmap from scratch. Look at Part 2 of your lab exercise and decide which scenario you want:"
> - "Crop farm seasonal plan"
> - "Equipment maintenance calendar"
> - "Livestock management year"

---

## Phase 6: Active Experimentation — Independent Practice (35 min) — 1:15

**[Slide 18: Independent Practice]**

> "Time to build your roadmap. Open Part 2 of your lab exercise."

> "You have three scenarios. Pick the one that fits your farm:"
> - "Scenario A — Crop Farm Seasonal Plan. You'll map out planting through harvest for multiple crops across 6 months."
> - "Scenario B — Equipment Maintenance Calendar. You'll schedule service, inspections, and seasonal prep across 12 months."
> - "Scenario C — Livestock Management Year. You'll plan breeding, vet visits, feeding cycles, and pasture rotation."

> "Each scenario gives you a list of Issues to create, custom fields to add, and iterations to set up. Follow the steps on your handout. You have 35 minutes."

> "Here's the key part — after you build the roadmap, EVALUATE it. Your handout has a checklist of problems to look for. I want you to find at least one conflict, bottleneck, or missing dependency. Write it down — we'll share as a group."

*Set a timer for 35 minutes. Walk the room constantly.*

**Common support needs during independent practice:**

| Issue | How to Help |
|-------|------------|
| Learner can't find the "+" for new fields | They may be in Board view, not Table view. Have them switch to Table view first. |
| Iteration setup is confusing | Walk through it: click "+", name the field, choose "Iteration," set start date and duration. Then edit the field to add more iterations. |
| Issues don't appear on Timeline | They need a date value or iteration assignment. Have them go back to Table view and fill in dates. |
| Timeline shows only dots, not bars | They set only one date. For bars, they need a start and end date range, or use iterations (which have built-in ranges). Suggest using iterations for grouping. |
| Learner wants to add Issues from another repo | Show them: click "Add item," type "#" and the repo name. The repo must be theirs. |
| Learner struggles to identify conflicts | Point to two overlapping bars and ask: "Do both of these need the same tractor?" or "Can one person do both of these in the same week?" |
| Learner finishes early | Point them to stretch challenges: cross-repo linking, grouping/filtering Timeline, building a second scenario. |
| Learner is stuck choosing a scenario | Ask about their farm. "Do you grow crops? Manage equipment? Have livestock?" Pick whichever matches. |

*At 15 minutes remaining:*

> "Fifteen minutes left. If you haven't switched to Timeline view yet, do that now. And start evaluating — look for overlapping bars, gaps, or tasks that should come before other tasks."

*At 5 minutes remaining:*

> "Five minutes! Finish up your evaluation. Write down at least one thing you noticed — a conflict, a bottleneck, or a missing step. We're going to share as a group."

---

## Phase 7: Evaluation Share (15 min) — 1:50

**[Slide 19-20: Evaluation Practice, Group Share]**

> "Let's hear what you found. This is the most important part of today — it's not just about building a pretty chart, it's about using it to make better decisions."

> "Who found a scheduling conflict? Two things that needed the same resource at the same time?"

*Take 2-3 responses. For each:*
- Ask what the conflict was
- Ask how they'd fix it
- Acknowledge the discovery: "That's exactly the kind of thing you catch in January, not in the middle of planting."

> "Who found a missing dependency? A task that should have been scheduled earlier, or a step that was missing entirely?"

*Take 2-3 responses.*

> "Who found a resource bottleneck? A week where too much was happening at once?"

*Take 1-2 responses.*

> "Every single one of these discoveries is more valuable than the tool itself. The roadmap didn't create these problems — they were already there. The roadmap just made them visible. That's the power of seeing your whole season at a glance."

*Write key discoveries on the whiteboard for the group to see.*

---

## Phase 8: Reflection (10 min) — 2:05

**[Slide 22: Reflection]**

> "Take a moment to think about your own farm."

> "Turn to your partner and discuss:"
> - "How would a seasonal roadmap change the way you plan your year?"
> - "What conflicts or bottlenecks do you already know about — but haven't had a way to visualize?"
> - "Would linking Issues from different areas — crops, equipment, livestock — help you see the full picture?"

*Allow 4 minutes for partner discussion.*

> "Who wants to share? How would this change your planning?"

*Take 2-3 responses from the group. Acknowledge each one.*

> "The beauty of this approach is that once it's built, you can update it as the season changes. Weather pushes planting back two weeks? Drag the bars. New equipment problem? Add an Issue and see where it fits. The plan stays alive."

---

## Phase 9: Wrap-Up (10 min) — 2:15

**[Slide 21: Key Vocabulary]**

> "Let's review the new terms from today."

*Go through each term. Ask learners to explain in their own words:*

- "Who can tell me what a custom field is?"
- "What's an iteration, in GitHub terms?"
- "What does the Timeline view show you that Board and Table views don't?"
- "What does it mean to link Issues from multiple repositories?"
- "What's a scheduling conflict? A resource bottleneck? A missing dependency?"

**[Slide 23: What's Next]**

> "Next session — Session 10 — we're introducing Copilot. You'll learn to use GitHub Copilot to help write Issue descriptions, improve documentation, and draft communication. Think of it as a farmhand who's also great with paperwork."

> "Before next session, here's what I'd encourage you to do:"
> - "Add more Issues to your seasonal roadmap — flesh it out"
> - "Try grouping your Timeline view by different fields — crop type, category, whatever makes sense"
> - "Experiment with dragging bars on the Timeline to adjust dates"
> - "If you have a second repository, try linking Issues from it into your Project"

**[Slide 24: Feedback Survey]**

> "Please fill out the quick survey before you leave. Your feedback helps us improve."

> "Thank you! You now have a bird's-eye view of your farm season — every planting date, every service appointment, every milestone on one screen. When plans change, and they always do, you can adjust the roadmap instead of rewriting your entire calendar. See you next session!"

---

## Buffer (10 min) — 2:25

Use this time for:
- Collecting remaining feedback surveys
- Helping learners who didn't finish the independent exercise
- Answering individual questions about custom fields, iterations, or Timeline view
- Helping learners who want to set up cross-repository linking
- 1-on-1 coaching for learners who struggled with evaluation concepts

---

## Emergency Procedures

**Internet goes down:**
- Use printed screenshots of custom field creation, iteration setup, and Timeline view
- Walk through the evaluation concepts using the whiteboard — draw a simple timeline with overlapping bars
- Have learners sketch their farm season on paper using a timeline format
- Focus on the evaluation skill: identify conflicts, bottlenecks, and dependencies on the paper timeline

**Projector fails:**
- Walk around and demonstrate on individual screens
- Pair experienced learners with those who need more help
- Use the printed lab exercise as the primary guide

**GitHub Projects v2 not available for a learner:**
- Confirm the learner is using the newer Projects experience (not classic Projects)
- If they see "Projects (classic)," help them create a new Project from their profile > "Your projects" > "New project"
- If Timeline view is unavailable, have them build the roadmap in Table view and discuss what a timeline would show

**Learner has no Project from Session 3:**
- Have them create a new Project following Step 1 of the guided practice
- They'll need to add Issues from scratch — allocate the first 5 minutes of guided practice for this

**Learner finishes early:**
- Try stretch challenges (cross-repo linking, grouping/filtering, second scenario)
- Help a neighboring learner who is stuck
- Experiment with saving filtered or grouped views
- Add more Issues to increase roadmap complexity

---

## Troubleshooting Table for Guided Practice

| Step | Common Problem | Quick Fix |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Step 1: Open Project | Learner can't find their Project | Go to profile avatar > "Your projects." If no Project exists, create a new one. |
| Step 2: Add Issues | "Create new issue" doesn't show a repo | Learner needs to select their repository from the dropdown. |
| Step 3: Date field | Calendar popup doesn't appear | Click directly in the date cell, not the row. Try clicking twice. |
| Step 4: Dropdown field | Can't add options | After typing an option name, press Enter or click "Add option" to save it. |
| Step 5: Number field | Learner types text in number field | Number fields only accept digits. Help them clear and retype. |
| Step 6: Iterations | "Iteration" not in field type list | Verify they're using Projects v2 (not classic). Iteration is a newer field type. |
| Step 6: Iterations | Can't add more iterations | Click the field column header > "Edit field" to access iteration management. |
| Step 7: Timeline view | "Roadmap" option not visible | Click the "+" next to view tabs, not the "+" for adding items. Check that at least one date field has values. |
| Step 7: Timeline view | All Issues stacked on one date | Learner likely set the same date for all Issues. Have them go back to Table view and spread dates across months. |

## L2 Observation Checklist

**During guided and independent practice, observe whether each learner can:**

- [ ] **Add a custom field** — Navigate to the "+" column button, create a field with the correct type (date, single select, or number), and fill in values for Issues
- [ ] **Create iterations** — Set up at least 3 iteration time blocks with appropriate names, start dates, and durations, and assign Issues to them
- [ ] **Build a Timeline view** — Switch to Roadmap layout, configure the date source, and navigate the visual calendar (scroll, zoom, click bars)
- [ ] **Link cross-repository Issues** — Use "Add item" with the "#" syntax to add an Issue from a different repository into the Project
- [ ] **Evaluate a roadmap** — Identify at least one scheduling conflict, resource bottleneck, or missing dependency by analyzing the Timeline view, and articulate how to fix it

**Scoring guidance:**
- **Demonstrated independently** — Learner completed the skill without instructor help
- **Demonstrated with help** — Learner completed the skill after a prompt or hint from the instructor
- **Not yet demonstrated** — Learner was unable to complete the skill during this session

**Notes space:**
