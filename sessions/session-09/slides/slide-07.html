    <p><b>Iterations = Time Blocks for Your Season</b></p>
    <p>On a farm, you think in seasons: planting window, growing period, harvest window, winter prep. Iterations divide your Project into these same time blocks.</p>
    <p>Each Issue gets assigned to an iteration — telling you not just <b>WHAT</b> to do, but <b>WHEN</b>.</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <p>Think of iterations like <b>chapters in your farm year</b>. Each chapter has a start date, end date, and a set of tasks.</p>
