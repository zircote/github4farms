    <ul>
      <li>Are any two high-effort tasks scheduled for the same week?</li>
      <li>Does any task depend on another task that hasn't been scheduled yet?</li>
      <li>Is there a period with no tasks? Should there be something there?</li>
      <li>Is any single person or piece of equipment over-committed?</li>
      <li>Are there enough buffer weeks between dependent tasks?</li>
