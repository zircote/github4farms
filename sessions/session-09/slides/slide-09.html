    <p>The Timeline view shows your Issues as <b>bars on a calendar</b> — stretching across weeks and months.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A horizontal calendar spanning 6+ months</li>
      <li>Each Issue appears as a colored bar from start to end date</li>
      <li>Issues in the same iteration cluster together</li>
      <li>Overlapping tasks and gaps jump out immediately</li>
