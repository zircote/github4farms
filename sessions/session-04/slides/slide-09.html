      <p><b>Pull Request = "Please Review My Changes"</b></p>
    </div>
    <p>After making changes in your fork, you send a <b>Pull Request</b> (PR) to the original repository. A Pull Request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shows exactly what you changed (green = added, red = removed)</li>
      <li>Lets the owner review before accepting</li>
      <li>Allows discussion — questions or suggested edits</li>
      <li>Keeps a permanent record of what changed and why</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like handing your marked-up copy to the farm manager: "What do you think?"</p>
