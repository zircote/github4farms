## The Collaboration Workflow

```
FORK  →  EDIT  →  PULL REQUEST  →  REVIEW  →  MERGE
```

| Step | What You Do | Farm Analogy |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1. Fork | Click "Fork" to make your own copy | Photocopy the farm plan |
| 2. Edit | Click the pencil icon, make changes, commit | Mark up your copy with suggestions |
| 3. Pull Request | Click "Contribute" → "Open pull request" | Hand your marked-up copy to the manager |
| 4. Review | Read changes (green = added, red = removed), comment | Manager reads your suggestions |
| 5. Merge | Click "Merge pull request" | Manager accepts changes into the official plan |

## How to Fork a Repository

1. Go to the repository you want to copy
2. Click **"Fork"** (top right area of the page)
3. Click **"Create fork"**
4. **You're now on your copy** — your username appears at the top

**How do I know it's my fork?** Look for "forked from [original name]" below the repository name.

## How to Edit a File

1. Navigate to the file in your fork
2. Click the **pencil icon** (top right of the file)
3. Make your changes
4. Scroll down to **"Commit changes"**
5. Write a short message about what you changed
6. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Good commit messages:**
- "Update Field 2 planting date — delayed by rain"
- "Add tractor 500-hour service record"
- "Fix vaccination date for Herd B — vet rescheduled"

**Bad commit messages:**
- "Update" (too vague)
- "Changes" (doesn't say what changed)

## When to Use Each Method

| Situation | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Editing your own personal repository | **Direct edit** — just click the pencil |
| Suggesting changes to a shared team repository | **Fork + Pull Request** — so someone can review |
| Small fix that doesn't need review | **Direct edit** (if you have permission) |
| Important change the team should see | **Pull Request** — always |

**Rule of thumb:** If other people depend on the document, use a Pull Request.

---

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Fork** | Your own copy of a shared repository |
| **Commit** | Saving changes with a description |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | A request to merge your changes into the original |
| **Review** | Reading and giving feedback on someone's changes |
| **Merge** | Accepting changes into the official version |
| **Approve** | Signing off that changes are ready |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find the Fork button | Top right area of the page, near Star and Watch |
| No pencil icon to edit | You might be on the original repo, not your fork — check the username in the URL |
| No "Contribute" banner | Use Pull requests tab → New pull request |
| Merge button grayed out | You may not have permission — ask the repository owner |
| Made a mistake in your edit | Edit the file again (pencil icon) or explain in the PR description |
