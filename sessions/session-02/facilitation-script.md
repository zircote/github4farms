## Pre-Session Setup (30 minutes before)

- [ ] Test projector and Wi-Fi
- [ ] Open demo farm repository on projector browser, logged into instructor account
- [ ] Pre-create 2-3 sample labels in the demo repository if not already present (equipment, livestock, crops, maintenance, urgent, routine, compliance)
- [ ] Prepare sample photos for learners who don't have their own (fence.jpg, tractor.jpg, field.jpg, calf.jpg, equipment.jpg — on USB drive in `session-02-samples` folder)
- [ ] Place at each seat: lab exercise, issue creation guide, feedback survey, pen
- [ ] Have USB drive with sample photos at the front table AND a shared link on the whiteboard
- [ ] Set up sign-in sheet
- [ ] Write on whiteboard: Wi-Fi password, demo repository URL

## Phase 1: Welcome & Hook (0:00 – 0:10)

### Script

> "Welcome back, everyone! Great to see you again.
>
> Let's start with a quick review. Can someone tell me: what is a repository?"
>
> [Wait for answer. Validate: "Exactly — it's your digital barn."]
>
> "Today we're adding something powerful to that barn. Let me ask you:
>
> How many of you have had a task on the farm that fell through the cracks? Maybe a fence repair that got forgotten, or a maintenance appointment that was missed?
>
> [Show of hands.]
>
> Today you're going to learn about **Issues** — GitHub's version of work orders. After today, you'll be able to create a digital task, assign it, track progress, and mark it complete. Nothing falls through the cracks when it's in GitHub.
>
> And here's the best part: you're also going to learn to attach photos to your tasks. Imagine taking a picture of a broken fence post with your phone and attaching it directly to the work order. Everyone can see exactly what needs fixing."

---

## Phase 2: Instructor Demo (0:10 – 0:25)

### Script

> "Let me show you the full workflow. Just watch for now.
>
> I have a broken fence post in the north pasture. I'm going to create a work order for it."

**[Navigate to demo repository → Issues tab]**

> "First, I click the 'Issues' tab. This is where all the work orders live.
>
> Now I click 'New issue.' This is like pulling out a blank work order form."

**[Click New issue]**

> "I type a clear title: 'Fix broken fence post — north pasture'
>
> Notice I said where the problem is. That way, whoever reads this knows exactly where to go."

**[Type title]**

> "Now the description. I'll write: 'Three fence posts are down on the north side of the pasture, near the creek crossing. Cattle could get through. Need 3 replacement posts and 20 feet of wire.'
>
> See how I included what happened, where, and what's needed?"

**[Type description]**

> "Now the fun part — I'm going to add a photo. I click this paperclip icon... select my photo... and there it is, right in the work order."

**[Upload photo. Wait for it to appear. Point it out.]**

> "I click Submit. Now my Issue is created — it has a number, #[X]."

**[Submit. Pause.]**

> "Now I'll add some labels. On the right side, I click Labels and select 'fencing' and 'urgent.'"

**[Add labels]**

> "And I'll assign it to myself — click Assignees, select my name."

**[Assign]**

> "Two days later, the repair is done. I come back and add a comment: 'Fixed today. Replaced 3 posts and restrung 20ft of wire. All secure.'"

**[Add comment]**

> "And I close the Issue. Done! This work order is now part of my farm's permanent record."

**[Close issue]**

> "Let's look at the closed Issues tab — there it is. Six months from now, if I need to know when that fence was fixed, I can find it in seconds."

## Phase 3: Guided Practice (0:25 – 0:45)

### Script

> "Now you try. Open your browser and go to the demo repository. The URL is on the whiteboard.
>
> Step 1: Click the Issues tab. Raise your hand when you see it."

**[Wait. Help stragglers.]**

> "Step 2: Click 'New issue.' You should see a blank form."

**[Wait for checkpoint.]**

> "Step 3: For your title, type: 'Test issue — [your name]'
>
> Step 4: For the description, type: 'This is my first GitHub Issue!'
>
> Step 5: Click Submit."

**[Wait. Major checkpoint — everyone must create an Issue.]**

> "**Checkpoint:** Raise your hand when you see your Issue with a number on the page."

**[Celebrate: "Look at that! You just created your first work order on GitHub!"]**

> "Great! One quick tip — if you made a typo, you can edit your Issue anytime. Click the three dots next to the title and choose Edit. Now let's add a label. On the right side of the page, click 'Labels' and pick one that sounds interesting."

**[Wait.]**

> "Now add a comment. Scroll down, type anything in the comment box, and click 'Comment.'"

**[Wait.]**

> "One more — close your Issue. Click 'Close issue' at the bottom."

**[Wait.]**

> "You just went through the entire lifecycle of a GitHub Issue: create, label, comment, close. That's the core workflow for tracking any farm task."

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "I can't find the Issues tab" | "It's in the row of tabs near the top: Code, Issues, Pull requests... Click 'Issues.'" |
| "New issue button doesn't work" | "Are you logged in? Click your profile icon in the top right — if it says 'Sign in,' you need to log in first." |
| "I don't see labels on the right" | "After submitting the Issue, look at the right side of the page. It might require scrolling on smaller screens." |
| "My photo won't upload" | "Check file size — under 10MB. Try JPG or PNG format. On a phone, try the camera icon. If it's still not working, skip the photo for now — you can add it later." |
| "I made a typo in my title" | "No problem! Click the three-dot menu (...) next to the title and choose Edit." |

## Phase 4: Concept Explanation (0:45 – 1:10)

### Script

> "Let's talk about what you just did and why it matters for your farm.
>
> An **Issue** is a digital work order. Anything that needs attention becomes an Issue.
>
> **Labels** are like color-coded tags. When you have 50 Issues, labels let you filter to see only equipment tasks, or only urgent items.
>
> **Comments** create a timeline. They answer the question 'what happened?' Months later, you can read the whole story of a task.
>
> **Closing** an Issue marks it done — but it's never deleted. Your farm builds a permanent, searchable history of everything that was done."

**Discussion prompt:**

> "Turn to your partner. Think of 3 tasks from your farm this week that you would create Issues for. What labels would you use? You have 3 minutes."

**[3 minutes. Then ask 3-4 volunteers to share.]**

> "[Respond specifically to each.]
>
> Those are perfect examples. Here's what I want you to notice — every one of you came up with real farm tasks. That means this tool is already relevant to your work."

**Vocabulary review (show Slide 21):**

> "Before our break, let's review today's vocabulary. You've got these on your cheat sheet:
> - Issue = work order
> - Label = color-coded tag
> - Assignee = who's on the job
> - Comment = progress update
> - Open = task pending
> - Closed = task done
>
> That's 6 new terms. Combined with Session 1, you now know 10 GitHub terms."

---

## BREAK (1:10 – 1:25)

> "15-minute break. When we come back, you'll create real farm Issues on your own."

### During Break
- [ ] Distribute sample photos to anyone who needs them (USB drive or shared link)
- [ ] Check: did anyone not complete the guided practice? Help them catch up.
- [ ] Note anyone who finished the guided practice very quickly

---

## Phase 5: Independent Practice (1:25 – 2:00)

### Script

> "Pick up the lab exercise sheet on your table. You have 35 minutes to work through it.
>
> Choose the farm scenario that interests you: crop farming, livestock, or equipment. You'll create 3 Issues, add labels and photos, comment on them, and close one.
>
> If you need a sample photo to upload, I have some on this USB drive / at this link.
>
> Remember:
> - Ask your partner first if you get stuck
> - Raise your hand if you're both stuck
> - The stretch challenges at the end are optional
>
> Go for it!"

### L2 Assessment — Observation Checklist

While circulating, record for each learner:

| Closes Issue | ☐ |
| Uses filter (stretch) | ☐ |

**Target:** 80%+ of learners demonstrate 5 of 6 core skills.

## Phase 6: Reflection (2:00 – 2:10)

### Script

> "Let's wrap up the practice. Even if you didn't finish everything, that's fine — the important thing is you created Issues and worked with them.
>
> Quick reflection: Think about your real farm. What's one task that's been on your mental to-do list that you'd want to put into a GitHub Issue right now?
>
> Turn to your partner and share. (2 minutes)"

**[2 minutes. Then ask for volunteers.]**

> "I heard some great examples. [Name] mentioned [specific example]. [Name] brought up [specific example]. These are exactly the kinds of tasks GitHub Issues are built for.
>
> Today you learned to create, manage, and close Issues — digital work orders for your farm. From now on, nothing has to fall through the cracks."

---

## Phase 7: Wrap-Up (2:10 – 2:20)

### Script

> "Here's what we covered:
> 1. Issues are digital work orders for any farm task
> 2. Labels help you organize and filter tasks
> 3. Photos make Issues visual — show the problem, not just describe it
> 4. Comments track progress over time
> 5. Closing an Issue creates a permanent record
>
> **Session 3** will teach you GitHub Projects — visual planning boards where you organize all your Issues into a big-picture plan for your farm season.
>
> **Optional homework:**
> - Create 2 more Issues in the demo repository for real farm tasks
> - Try creating an Issue from your phone
> - Upload a real photo from your farm
>
> Please fill out your feedback survey. See you at Session 3!"

---

## Phase 8: Buffer (2:20 – 2:30)

- [ ] Collect feedback surveys
- [ ] Help any learner who didn't complete the exercise
- [ ] Record attendance
- [ ] Note learners needing extra support
- [ ] Note fast finishers

---

## Post-Session (within 24 hours)

- [ ] Write debrief: `delivery/session-02-debrief.md`
- [ ] Enter L1 feedback data
- [ ] Record L2 assessment observations
- [ ] Check: did the photo upload work across all device types? Note any issues for device-specific guides.
- [ ] Adjust Session 3 materials if needed

---

## Emergency Procedures

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Photo upload failing for many learners | Skip photo upload; focus on text-only Issues. Add photo practice to Session 3 warm-up. |
| Demo repository has too many test Issues | Clean up by closing/deleting test Issues before next session. Or create a fresh demo repo. |
| Learner from Session 1 is absent | Pair them with an experienced partner. Give them 10 minutes during guided practice to create their GitHub account. Provide Session 1 cheat sheet. |
| Labels not showing in repository | Instructor must create labels first. Go to Issues → Labels → New label. Create the farm labels listed in the slides. |
