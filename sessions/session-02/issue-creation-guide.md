## Page 1: Creating an Issue

### Step 1: Go to the Issues Tab

From your repository page, find and click **"Issues"** in the tab bar near the top of the page.

*It's between "Code" and "Pull requests."*

---

### Step 2: Click "New issue"

Click the green **"New issue"** button on the right side.

---

### Step 3: Write a Clear Title

Type a short, specific title that tells anyone what needs to be done.

**Good:** "Fix broken fence post — north pasture"
**Bad:** "Problem" or "Help"

---

### Step 4: Write the Description

In the large text box, describe the task:
- **What** needs to be done
- **Where** is the issue
- **When** does it need to happen
- **How urgent** is it

---

### Step 5: Upload a Photo (Optional)

Click the **paperclip icon** at the bottom of the description box.

Select a photo from your device. Wait for it to upload.

**Where are my photos?**
- **Phone:** Use the camera icon to take a photo directly, or browse your photo library
- **Laptop:** Check your Downloads folder or Pictures folder
- **Emailed yourself a photo?** Save it to Downloads first, then upload

*Tip: On mobile, you can take a photo directly from within GitHub using the camera icon.*

---

### Step 6: Submit

Click the green **"Submit new issue"** button.

Your Issue now has a number (like #1, #2, etc.) and is visible to everyone with access to the repository.

## Page 2: Managing Your Issues

### Adding Labels

1. On the Issue page, look at the **right side of the page**
2. Click **"Labels"**
3. Select one or more labels from the list
4. Click outside the menu to close it

**Common farm labels:**

| Label | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| equipment | Machines, tools, vehicles |
| livestock | Animal care and health |
| crops | Planting, harvest, field work |
| maintenance | Routine upkeep |
| urgent | Needs attention today |

### Assigning to Someone

1. On the right side of the page, click **"Assignees"**
2. Select a name from the list (or assign to yourself)
3. Click outside to close

---

### Adding a Comment

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue
2. Type your update in the comment box
3. Click **"Comment"**

Use comments for progress updates:
- "Parts ordered — arriving Thursday"
- "Repair complete — used 3 posts and 20ft wire"
- "Vet appointment confirmed for April 2"

---

### Closing an Issue

When the task is done:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue
2. Click **"Close issue"** (or **"Close with comment"** to add a final note)

The Issue moves from "Open" to "Closed" but is **never deleted**. You can always find it later.

---

### Reopening an Issue

If a closed task needs attention again:

1. Open the closed Issue
2. Click **"Reopen issue"** at the bottom

---

### Filtering Your Issues

On the Issues tab:
- Click **"Open"** to see pending tasks
- Click **"Closed"** to see completed tasks
- Click a **label name** to see only Issues with that label
- Use the **search bar** to find Issues by keyword

## Quick Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Write titles as if someone else will read them | They probably will — keep titles clear and specific |
| Upload photos for visual problems | A picture of a broken fence is worth a thousand words |
| Comment before closing | Record what was done so there's a complete history |
| Use labels consistently | Makes filtering and searching much easier |
| One task per Issue | Don't combine multiple tasks — create separate Issues |
| Made a mistake? Edit it! | Click the **...** menu on the Issue and select "Edit" to fix the title or description |
