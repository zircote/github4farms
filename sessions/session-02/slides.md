### Slide 1 — Title

**GitHub Issues for Task Tracking**
*Turning Farm Tasks into Digital Work Orders*

Session 2 of 12 — GitHub Training for Farmers

---

### Slide 2 — Welcome Back

**Welcome to Session 2!**

Last time you learned to navigate a repository — your digital barn.

Today you'll learn to create **Issues** — GitHub's version of work orders.

By the end of today, you will have created, labeled, commented on, and closed your own Issues.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

How do you keep track of what needs to be done on your farm?

- A paper list?
- Text messages?
- Sticky notes?
- Memory?

*What happens when a task falls through the cracks?*

> Instructor note: Let 2-3 learners answer. "Has anyone ever forgotten a task because it wasn't written down?"

---

### Slide 4 — The Problem

**Farm tasks get lost.**

- Paper lists get wet, torn, or misplaced
- Text messages get buried
- Verbal instructions are forgotten
- Nobody knows what's done and what's still pending
- When someone leaves, their knowledge goes with them

**What if every task was tracked, searchable, and never lost?**

---

### Slide 5 — What Is an Issue?

**Issue = Digital Work Order**

A GitHub Issue is a task, job, or item that needs attention. Each Issue has:

- **Title** — What needs to be done (short and clear)
- **Description** — Details about the task
- **Labels** — Color-coded tags to categorize it
- **Assignee** — Who is responsible
- **Status** — Open (needs doing) or Closed (done)
- **Comments** — Updates and discussion

Think of it as writing a work order that everyone on the farm can see.

---

### Slide 6 — Issue Examples from the Farm

| Farm Task | Issue Title | Labels |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Fence post broken in north pasture | "Fix broken fence post — north pasture" | fencing, urgent |
| Tractor needs oil change | "Tractor oil change due" | equipment, maintenance |
| Order seeds for spring planting | "Order corn and soybean seeds" | crops, routine |
| Vaccination due for Herd B | "Schedule Herd B vaccinations" | livestock, health |
| Submit grant progress report | "USDA EQIP Q2 report due June 15" | compliance, deadline |

Every type of farm task can become an Issue.

---

### Slide 7 — Anatomy of an Issue

**An Issue page has these parts:**

1. **Title** — At the top, in large text
2. **Description body** — The main area with details (supports text, photos, checklists)
3. **Labels** — Colored tags on the right side
4. **Assignees** — Who's responsible (right side)
5. **Comment section** — Below the description, for updates
6. **Close button** — Marks the Issue as done

> Instructor note: Show a real Issue on the projector. Point to each part.

---

### Slide 8 — Labels: Color-Coded Categories

**Labels help you filter and find Issues quickly.**

| Label | Color | Used For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| equipment | Blue | Anything about machines, tools, vehicles |
| livestock | Green | Animal health, feeding, breeding |
| crops | Yellow | Planting, harvesting, crop records |
| maintenance | Orange | Routine upkeep and repairs |
| urgent | Red | Needs attention today |
| routine | Gray | Regular scheduled tasks |
| compliance | Purple | Grants, certifications, audits |

You can create your own labels too — we'll do that later in the curriculum.

---

### Slide 9 — Creating an Issue: Step by Step

**How to create a new Issue:**

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the **"Issues"** tab (near the top of the page)
3. Click the green **"New issue"** button
4. Type a clear **title** (what needs to be done)
5. Add a **description** (details, context, steps)
6. Click **"Submit new issue"**

That's it — 6 steps. Let me show you.

> Instructor note: Demonstrate live on the projector. Go slowly. Narrate each click.

---

### Slide 10 — Writing a Good Title

**Good titles are short and specific.**

| Bad Title | Good Title |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Problem" | "Fix broken fence post — north pasture" |
| "Tractor" | "Tractor oil change due — 500 hour service" |
| "Seeds" | "Order corn and soybean seeds for spring planting" |
| "Help needed" | "Irrigation leak in Field 2 — needs repair by Friday" |

**Rule of thumb:** Someone should know what the task is just from reading the title.

---

### Slide 11 — Writing a Description

**The description gives details about the task.**

A good description answers:
- **What** needs to be done?
- **Where** is the problem?
- **When** does it need to happen?
- **How urgent** is it?

You can also:
- Upload **photos** (click the image icon or drag a photo in)
- Add a **checklist** (type `- [ ]` to create a checkbox for each item)
- Include **links** to other information

---

### Slide 12 — Uploading Photos

**Adding a photo to an Issue is easy:**

1. Click in the description box
2. Drag a photo from your desktop into the box, OR
3. Click the **paperclip icon** at the bottom of the text box
4. Select a photo from your device
5. Wait for it to upload (you'll see a progress bar)
6. The photo appears in the description

**Farm example:** Take a photo of the broken fence post and attach it to the Issue. Now everyone can see exactly what needs fixing.

> Instructor note: Demo uploading a photo. Test on both laptop and phone if possible.

---

### Slide 13 — Adding Labels and Assignees

**After creating an Issue, add labels and assign it:**

1. On the Issue page, look at the right sidebar
2. Click **"Labels"** — select one or more from the list
3. Click **"Assignees"** — select yourself or a team member

Labels and assignees help you:
- **Filter** your Issue list (show only "equipment" Issues)
- **Know who's responsible** for each task
- **Prioritize** (see all "urgent" Issues at once)

---

### Slide 14 — Commenting on Issues

**Comments let you add updates and discuss tasks.**

To add a comment:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue page
2. Type your update in the comment box
3. Click **"Comment"**

**Farm examples of comments:**
- "Ordered the replacement post. Arriving Thursday."
- "Fixed the fence. Used 3 new posts and 20ft of wire."
- "Vet says vaccinations need to happen before May 1."

Comments create a timeline of the task's progress — who said what, when.

---

### Slide 15 — Closing an Issue

**When a task is done, close the Issue.**

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue
2. Click **"Close issue"** (or "Close with comment" to add a final note)

A closed Issue:
- Turns from "Open" to "Closed"
- Stays in your repository forever (it's not deleted!)
- Can be reopened if the task comes back
- Becomes part of your farm's permanent record

---

### Slide 16 — Open vs. Closed

**Your Issue list has two views:**

- **Open** — Tasks that still need doing
- **Closed** — Tasks that are done

Toggle between them using the "Open" and "Closed" buttons at the top of the Issues list.

**Closed Issues are your farm's history.** Six months from now, you can look back and see exactly when the fence was fixed, what materials were used, and who did it.

---

### Slide 17 — Live Demo: Full Workflow

**Watch me create, label, comment on, and close an Issue.**

Scenario: A broken fence post in the north pasture.

> Instructor note: Perform the full workflow live:
> 1. Navigate to Issues tab
> 2. Click "New issue"
> 3. Title: "Fix broken fence post — north pasture"
> 4. Description: details + upload a photo

---

### Slide 18 — Guided Practice

**Your turn! Follow along with me.**

1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click the **Issues** tab
3. Click **"New issue"**
4. Title: "Test issue — [your name]"

For each Issue:
1. Write a clear title
2. Add a description
3. Upload at least 1 photo (use a sample photo provided)
4. Add a label
5. Comment with an update
6. Close 1 of the 3 Issues

---

### Slide 21 — Key Vocabulary Review

| GitHub Term | Farm Analogy | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Issue | Work order | A task that needs attention |
| Label | Color-coded tag | Categorizes Issues by type |
| Assignee | Who's on the job | Person responsible for the task |

| Closed | Job complete | Task is finished |

---

### Slide 22 — Reflection

**Think about your farm:**

- What are 3 tasks from this week that you would create Issues for?
- Which labels would you use?

Tell your partner. (2 minutes)

---

### Slide 23 — What's Next
