### Slide 1 — Title

**GitHub Issues for Task Tracking**
*Turning Farm Tasks into Digital Work Orders*

Session 2 of 12 — GitHub Training for Farmers

---

### Slide 2 — Welcome Back

**Welcome to Session 2!**

Last time you learned to navigate a repository — your digital barn.

Today you'll learn to create **Issues** — GitHub's version of work orders.

By the end of today, you will have created, labeled, commented on, and closed your own Issues.

---

### Slide 3 — Why This Matters for YOUR Farm

**Quick Question:**

How do you keep track of what needs to be done on your farm?

- A paper list?
- Text messages?
- Sticky notes?
- Memory?

*What happens when a task falls through the cracks?*

> Instructor note: Let 2-3 learners answer. "Has anyone ever forgotten a task because it wasn't written down?"

---

### Slide 4 — The Problem

**Farm tasks get lost.**

- Paper lists get wet, torn, or misplaced
- Text messages get buried
- Verbal instructions are forgotten
- Nobody knows what's done and what's still pending
- When someone leaves, their knowledge goes with them

**What if every task was tracked, searchable, and never lost?**

---

### Slide 5 — What Is an Issue?

**Issue = Digital Work Order**

A GitHub Issue is a task, job, or item that needs attention. Each Issue has:

- **Title** — What needs to be done (short and clear)
- **Description** — Details about the task
- **Labels** — Color-coded tags to categorize it
- **Assignee** — Who is responsible
- **Status** — Open (needs doing) or Closed (done)
- **Comments** — Updates and discussion

Think of it as writing a work order that everyone on the farm can see.

---

### Slide 6 — Issue Examples from the Farm

| Farm Task | Issue Title | Labels |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Fence post broken in north pasture | "Fix broken fence post — north pasture" | fencing, urgent |
| Tractor needs oil change | "Tractor oil change due" | equipment, maintenance |
| Order seeds for spring planting | "Order corn and soybean seeds" | crops, routine |
| Vaccination due for Herd B | "Schedule Herd B vaccinations" | livestock, health |
| Submit grant progress report | "USDA EQIP Q2 report due June 15" | compliance, deadline |

Every type of farm task can become an Issue.

---

### Slide 7 — Anatomy of an Issue (Part 1)

**The main parts of an Issue:**

1. **Title** — At the top, in large text. This is what everyone sees first.
2. **Description body** — The main area with details (supports text, photos, checklists)
3. **Comment section** — Below the description, for progress updates

These are the parts you'll use most. Let's look at each one.

> Instructor note: Show a real Issue on the projector. Point to each part slowly.

---

### Slide 7b — Anatomy of an Issue (Part 2)

**More parts — on the right side of the page:**

4. **Labels** — Colored tags to categorize your Issue
5. **Assignees** — Who's responsible for this task
6. **Close button** — Marks the Issue as done

**Tip:** Made a typo? You can edit any Issue after creating it. Click the **three-dot menu (...)** next to the title and choose **"Edit."**

> Instructor note: Point to the right side of the page on the projector. Show the edit option briefly.

---

### Slide 8 — Labels: Color-Coded Categories

**Labels help you filter and find Issues quickly.**

| Label | Color | Used For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| equipment | Blue | Anything about machines, tools, vehicles |
| livestock | Green | Animal health, feeding, breeding |
| crops | Yellow | Planting, harvesting, crop records |
| maintenance | Orange | Routine upkeep and repairs |
| urgent | Red | Needs attention today |
| routine | Gray | Regular scheduled tasks |
| compliance | Purple | Grants, certifications, audits |

You can create your own labels too — we'll do that later in the curriculum.

---

### Slide 9 — Creating an Issue: Step by Step

**How to create a new Issue:**

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the **"Issues"** tab (near the top of the page)
3. Click the green **"New issue"** button
4. Type a clear **title** (what needs to be done)
5. Add a **description** (details, context, steps)
6. Click **"Submit new issue"**

That's it — 6 steps. Let me show you.

> Instructor note: Demonstrate live on the projector. Go slowly. Narrate each click.

---

### Slide 10 — Writing a Good Title

**Good titles are short and specific.**

| Bad Title | Good Title |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Problem" | "Fix broken fence post — north pasture" |
| "Tractor" | "Tractor oil change due — 500 hour service" |
| "Seeds" | "Order corn and soybean seeds for spring planting" |
| "Help needed" | "Irrigation leak in Field 2 — needs repair by Friday" |

**Rule of thumb:** Someone should know what the task is just from reading the title.

---

### Slide 11 — Writing a Description

**The description gives details about the task.**

A good description answers:
- **What** needs to be done?
- **Where** is the problem?
- **When** does it need to happen?
- **How urgent** is it?

You can also:
- Upload **photos** (click the image icon or drag a photo in)
- Add a **checklist** (type `- [ ]` to create a checkbox for each item)
- Include **links** to other information

---

### Slide 12 — Uploading Photos

**Adding a photo to an Issue is easy:**

1. Click in the description box
2. Click the **paperclip icon** at the bottom of the text box
3. Select a photo from your device
4. Wait for it to upload (you'll see a progress bar)
5. The photo appears in the description

**Where are my photos?**
- **On your phone:** Use the camera icon to take a photo directly, or browse your photo library
- **On a laptop:** Check your **Downloads** folder or **Pictures** folder
- **Emailed yourself a photo?** Save it to Downloads first, then upload

**Farm example:** Take a photo of the broken fence post and attach it to the Issue. Now everyone can see exactly what needs fixing.

**If photos aren't working, skip it for now.** You can always add a photo later by editing the Issue.

> Instructor note: Demo uploading a photo. Show both the paperclip method and the drag method. Test on laptop and phone if possible.

---

### Slide 13 — Adding Labels and Assignees

**After creating an Issue, add labels and assign it:**

1. On the Issue page, look at the right side of the page
2. Click **"Labels"** — select one or more from the list
3. Click **"Assignees"** — select yourself or a team member

Labels and assignees help you:
- **Filter** your Issue list (show only "equipment" Issues)
- **Know who's responsible** for each task
- **Prioritize** (see all "urgent" Issues at once)

---

### Slide 14 — Commenting on Issues

**Comments let you add updates and discuss tasks.**

To add a comment:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue page
2. Type your update in the comment box
3. Click **"Comment"**

**Farm examples of comments:**
- "Ordered the replacement post. Arriving Thursday."
- "Fixed the fence. Used 3 new posts and 20ft of wire."
- "Vet says vaccinations need to happen before May 1."

Comments create a timeline of the task's progress — who said what, when.

---

### Slide 15 — Closing an Issue

**When a task is done, close the Issue.**

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Issue
2. Click **"Close issue"** (or "Close with comment" to add a final note)

**Important:** Adding a comment does NOT close the Issue. You must click the "Close issue" button to mark it done.

A closed Issue:
- Turns from "Open" to "Closed"
- Stays in your repository forever (it's not deleted!)
- Can be reopened if the task comes back
- Becomes part of your farm's permanent record

---

### Slide 16 — Open vs. Closed

**Your Issue list has two views:**

- **Open** — Tasks that still need doing
- **Closed** — Tasks that are done

Toggle between them using the "Open" and "Closed" buttons at the top of the Issues list.

**Closed Issues are your farm's history.** Six months from now, you can look back and see exactly when the fence was fixed, what materials were used, and who did it.

---

### Slide 17 — Live Demo: Full Workflow

**Watch me create, label, comment on, and close an Issue.**

Scenario: A broken fence post in the north pasture.

> Instructor note: Perform the full workflow live:
> 1. Navigate to Issues tab
> 2. Click "New issue"
> 3. Title: "Fix broken fence post — north pasture"
> 4. Description: details + upload a photo
> 5. Submit
> 6. Add labels: fencing, urgent
> 7. Assign to self
> 8. Add comment: "Ordered replacement post. Arriving Thursday."
> 9. Add comment: "Fixed today. 3 new posts, 20ft wire."
> 10. Close the Issue

---

### Slide 18 — Guided Practice

**Your turn! Follow along with me.**

1. Go to the demo farm repository
2. Click the **Issues** tab
3. Click **"New issue"**
4. Title: "Test issue — [your name]"
5. Description: "This is my first GitHub Issue!"
6. Click **Submit new issue**

**Checkpoint:** Raise your hand when you see your Issue on the page.

> Instructor note: Walk through each step on projector. Pause at checkpoint.

---

### Slide 19 — BREAK (15 Minutes)

**Take 15 minutes.**

When we come back, you'll create real farm Issues on your own!

---

### Slide 20 — Independent Practice Introduction

**Your challenge: Create 3 farm Issues.**

Choose the scenario that fits your farm:

- **Option A: Crop Farming** — Create Issues for planting tasks
- **Option B: Livestock** — Create Issues for animal care tasks
- **Option C: Equipment** — Create Issues for maintenance tasks

For each Issue:
1. Write a clear title
2. Add a description
3. Upload at least 1 photo (use a sample photo provided)
4. Add a label
5. Comment with an update
6. Close 1 of the 3 Issues

---

### Slide 21 — Key Vocabulary Review

| GitHub Term | Farm Analogy | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Issue | Work order | A task that needs attention |
| Label | Color-coded tag | Categorizes Issues by type |
| Assignee | Who's on the job | Person responsible for the task |
| Comment | Progress update | A note added to an Issue |
| Open | Pending work | Task still needs doing |
| Closed | Job complete | Task is finished |

---

### Slide 22 — Reflection

**Think about your farm:**

- What are 3 tasks from this week that you would create Issues for?
- Which labels would you use?

Tell your partner. (2 minutes)

---

### Slide 23 — What's Next

**Session 3: GitHub Projects for Planning**

Next time, you'll learn to organize your Issues into visual planning boards — like a whiteboard for your farm's season.

**Optional between-session practice:**
- Create 2 more Issues in the demo repository for real farm tasks
- Try uploading a real photo from your phone

---

### Slide 24 — Feedback Survey

**Please fill out the 2-minute survey before you leave.**

Thank you! You now know how to create, track, and close farm tasks on GitHub.

## Slide Notes Summary

- **Total slides:** 25 (Slide 7 split into 7 and 7b)
- **New concepts introduced:** 5 (Issue, label, assignee, comment, open/closed)
- **Practice time:** ~70 minutes (guided practice + independent practice + reflection)
- **Photo upload tested:** Demonstrated across laptop and mobile

## UDL Implementation Notes

### Representation (3+ modes)
1. **Visual:** Projected slides with Issue anatomy diagrams and label color tables
2. **Verbal:** Instructor narration using "Issue = Digital Work Order" analogy throughout
3. **Written:** Printed issue creation guide (two-sided take-home reference)
4. **Photographic:** Photo upload demonstrated — visual learners see real farm images attached to Issues
5. **Tabular:** Good vs. Bad title comparison table (Slide 10) for pattern recognition

### Engagement (learner choice)
- **Three scenario options** in lab exercise (crops, livestock, equipment)
- **Photo upload is optional** — learners choose whether to add a photo or skip
- **Open-ended Issue #3** in lab: learners create a real farm task of their choosing (with fallback suggestions)
- **Stretch challenges** for fast finishers (create checklist, help a partner, upload photos to all Issues)
- **"Why This Matters for YOUR Farm"** opening with show-of-hands engagement

### Action & Expression (multi-method assessment)
- **L1 (Reaction):** Paper feedback survey
- **L2 (Observation):** 6-skill checklist (create Issue, write description, upload photo, apply label, add comment, close Issue)
- **Hands-on product:** Learners produce 3 Issues with labels, comments, and at least 1 photo — observable artifacts
- **Verbal reflection:** Partner discussion on "3 tasks from your farm this week"
- **Written checkpoint questions** embedded in lab exercise (Issue number, label name, open/closed counts)
