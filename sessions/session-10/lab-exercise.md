# Lab Exercise: GitHub Copilot Basics

> **Session 10: GitHub Copilot Basics**
> **Duration:** 55 minutes (Guided: 20 min + Independent: 35 min)
> **Prerequisites:** GitHub account, repository you own, familiarity with Issues (Session 2), Copilot access enabled
> **Theme:** "Your AI assistant for farm task writing"

---

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll use GitHub Copilot to draft an Issue description for a farm task, evaluate Copilot's output for accuracy and relevance, edit the draft to fit your farm, and compare the experience to writing manually. By the end, you'll have a clear sense of when Copilot helps most and when your own writing is the better choice.

---

## Part 1: Guided Practice (20 minutes)

**Follow along with the instructor.**

### Step 1: Open Your Repository and Create a New Issue

1. Go to your farm repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Issues"** tab at the top of the page
3. Click the green **"New issue"** button
4. In the **Title** field, type: `Spring Planting Prep - Practice Issue`

**What you should see:** A blank Issue form with a title field and a description box.

### Step 2: Access Copilot

1. Click inside the **description box** (the large text area below the title)
2. Look for the **Copilot icon** --- a small sparkle icon near the text area toolbar, or a Copilot Chat panel on the right side of the screen
3. Click the Copilot icon to open the AI assistant

**What you should see:** A Copilot panel, chat window, or inline suggestion area ready for your input.

> **If you don't see a Copilot icon:** Raise your hand. The instructor will help you check your Copilot access settings. You can also try typing in the description box --- Copilot may show inline suggestions as gray text.

### Step 3: Write a Prompt for Copilot

In the Copilot chat or prompt area, type the following:

> Write an Issue description for spring planting preparation on a small family farm. Include a checklist with soil testing, seed ordering, equipment inspection, and field preparation steps. Use markdown formatting with checkboxes.

**What you should see:** Copilot generates a draft description with a structured checklist.

> **Tip:** If Copilot gives a very short response, try adding more detail to your prompt. For example: "Include estimated time for each step and a section for supplies needed."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Copilot Draft

Before accepting anything, review the draft Copilot generated. Ask yourself:

**Accuracy Check:**
- [ ] Are the steps in a logical order?
- [ ] Are any facts or details incorrect?
- [ ] Does anything seem made up or generic?

**Completeness Check:**
- [ ] Are all the major steps included?
- [ ] Is anything important missing?
- [ ] Is there enough detail for someone else to follow?

**Relevance Check:**
- [ ] Does this match the type of farming I do?
- [ ] Would these steps actually work on my farm?
- [ ] Are there items that don't apply to my situation?

**Write your evaluation notes here:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What did Copilot get right? | |
| What did Copilot get wrong or miss? | |
| What needs to change for MY farm? | |

### Step 5: Edit the Draft

Now customize the Copilot draft to fit your farm:

1. **Copy** the Copilot-generated text into the Issue description box (if not already there)
2. **Delete** any steps that don't apply to your farm
3. **Add** steps that Copilot missed but you know are important
4. **Edit** the wording to match your actual practices, equipment, and fields
5. **Reorder** steps if Copilot put them in the wrong sequence

### Step 6: Submit the Issue

1. Review your final edited description one more time
2. Click **"Submit new issue"**
3. Open the Issue and read it as if you were seeing it for the first time

**What you should see:** A well-organized Issue with a checklist that reflects your farm's actual needs.

### Guided Practice Checkpoint

## Part 2: Independent Practice (35 minutes)

**Compare manual writing vs. Copilot-assisted writing using your chosen scenario.**

### Choose Your Scenario

Pick the scenario that best matches your farm:

---

#### Scenario A: Spring Planting Prep Checklist (Crops)

**Task 1 --- Write Manually (10 minutes):**

Create a new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Spring Planting Prep - [Your Field Name]`
- **Description:** Write a complete planting preparation checklist from memory. Include all the steps you would actually take to prepare for planting season. Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for each step.

Do NOT use Copilot for this Issue. Write everything yourself.

**Task 2 --- Write with Copilot (10 minutes):**

Create another new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Seasonal Crop Rotation Plan - [Your Field Name]`
- **Description:** Use Copilot to draft the description. Try this prompt (or write your own):

> Write an Issue description for a seasonal crop rotation plan on a [YOUR FARM SIZE]-acre farm growing [YOUR CROPS] in [YOUR STATE/REGION]. Include a checklist for soil analysis, crop selection for each field, seed ordering, and timeline for field preparation. Use markdown with checkboxes and section headers.

After Copilot generates the draft:
1. Evaluate it (accurate? complete? relevant?)
2. Edit it to match your actual farm
3. Submit the Issue

---

#### Scenario B: Equipment Maintenance Schedule (Equipment)

**Task 1 --- Write Manually (10 minutes):**

Create a new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Monthly Equipment Maintenance - [Month]`
- **Description:** Write a complete equipment maintenance checklist from memory. Include all machines, vehicles, and tools you maintain. Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for each item.

Do NOT use Copilot for this Issue. Write everything yourself.

**Task 2 --- Write with Copilot (10 minutes):**

Create another new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Pre-Season Equipment Inspection - [Season]`
- **Description:** Use Copilot to draft the description. Try this prompt (or write your own):

> Write an Issue description for a pre-season equipment inspection on a farm with [YOUR EQUIPMENT LIST, e.g., "two tractors, a combine, irrigation pump, and ATV"]. Include a checklist organized by equipment type, covering fluid levels, tire and track condition, safety equipment, and calibration. Use markdown with checkboxes and section headers.

After Copilot generates the draft:
1. Evaluate it (accurate? complete? relevant?)
2. Edit it to match your actual equipment
3. Submit the Issue

---

#### Scenario C: Livestock Vaccination Plan (Livestock)

**Task 1 --- Write Manually (10 minutes):**

Create a new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Spring Vaccination Schedule - [Your Herd/Flock]`
- **Description:** Write a complete vaccination and health check plan from memory. Include animals, vaccines, dates, and any record-keeping steps. Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for each item.

Do NOT use Copilot for this Issue. Write everything yourself.

**Task 2 --- Write with Copilot (10 minutes):**

Create another new Issue in your repository:
- **Title:** `Annual Livestock Health Plan - [Year]`
- **Description:** Use Copilot to draft the description. Try this prompt (or write your own):

> Write an Issue description for an annual livestock health plan for a [YOUR HERD SIZE]-head [YOUR ANIMAL TYPE] operation in [YOUR STATE/REGION]. Include a checklist for spring vaccinations, deworming schedule, veterinary visit planning, and health record updates. Use markdown with checkboxes and section headers.

After Copilot generates the draft:
1. Evaluate it (accurate? complete? relevant?)
2. Edit it to match your actual livestock and vet protocols
3. Submit the Issue

---

### Task 3: Compare Your Results (10 minutes)

Now compare the two Issues you created:

**Open both Issues side by side** (or switch between browser tabs) and fill out this comparison:

| Comparison | Manual Issue | Copilot-Assisted Issue |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Time to write** (estimate in minutes) | | |
| **Number of checklist items** | | |
| **How detailed is the description?** (1-5) | | |
| **How well does it match my farm?** (1-5) | | |
| **How organized is the structure?** (1-5) | | |
| **Overall quality** (1-5) | | |

**Answer these questions:**

1. Which Issue took less time to create? By how much?
2. Which Issue was more detailed and better organized?
3. Which Issue better matches your actual farm needs?
4. If you could only use one approach from now on, which would you pick? Why?
5. When is Copilot most helpful? When is manual writing better?

---

### Independent Practice Checklist

- [ ] I chose a scenario (A, B, or C)
- [ ] I wrote a complete Issue description manually (no Copilot)
- [ ] I wrote a second Issue description using Copilot
- [ ] I evaluated Copilot's draft for accuracy, completeness, and relevance
- [ ] I edited the Copilot draft to fit my farm
- [ ] I submitted both Issues
- [ ] I compared the two approaches using the comparison table
- [ ] I answered the reflection questions

---

## Stretch Challenges

**Finished early? Try one of these:**

1. **Try a different scenario:** Pick a second scenario from the list and repeat the manual vs. Copilot comparison. Do you get similar results?

2. **Experiment with prompts:** For the same task, try three different prompts --- one very short, one medium, and one very detailed. Compare the Copilot output. How does prompt quality affect the result?

3. **Peer review:** Swap screens with your partner. Read their Copilot-generated Issue and evaluate it. Can you spot things they might want to change? Share your feedback.

4. **Combine approaches:** Start writing an Issue manually, then partway through, ask Copilot to complete it. Does the combined approach give you the best of both worlds?

5. **Teach the concept:** Write a 3-sentence explanation of Copilot that you could share with a fellow farmer who has never heard of it. Use plain language and a farm analogy.

## Troubleshooting Guide

**If something goes wrong, check here first:**

| Problem | What to Check | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| I don't see a Copilot icon | Your account may not have Copilot enabled | Check your GitHub settings or ask the instructor to verify Copilot access |
| Copilot isn't generating anything | Your prompt may be too short or vague | Add more detail: name the task, your farm type, and what format you want |
| Copilot's suggestion is completely off-topic | Your prompt may be unclear | Rewrite the prompt with more specific context about your farm |
| The generated text is very short | Ask Copilot to expand | Type a follow-up: "Please add more detail, including a checklist with checkboxes" |
| I can't figure out how to edit the draft | The draft is just text you can change | Select any part of the text and type over it, or delete and rewrite sections |
| Copilot keeps giving me code instead of text | Copilot may interpret your request as a coding task | Add "This is for a GitHub Issue description, not code" to your prompt |
| The Copilot panel disappeared | It may have closed or minimized | Look for the Copilot icon in the toolbar and click it again |

**Still stuck?** Raise your hand and the instructor will help.

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, discuss with your partner:

1. **What surprised you most about using Copilot?** Was it better or worse than you expected?
2. **What did Copilot get right that you might have forgotten?** Did it suggest steps you wouldn't have thought to include?
3. **What did Copilot get wrong about your farm?** How did you fix it?
4. **When would you use Copilot in the future?** For which kinds of tasks?
5. **How would you explain the value of Copilot to a neighbor?** What's the one-sentence pitch?
6. **On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel using Copilot to draft Issues?** What would increase your confidence?
