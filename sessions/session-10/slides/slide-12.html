    <p><b>After Copilot gives you a draft, ask three questions:</b></p>
    <p><b>1. Is it ACCURATE?</b> Are the facts correct? Steps in the right order?</p>
    <p><b>2. Is it COMPLETE?</b> Did it cover all the steps? Anything missing?</p>
    <p><b>3. Is it RELEVANT to MY farm?</b> Does it match my crops, animals, equipment, and local conditions?</p>
