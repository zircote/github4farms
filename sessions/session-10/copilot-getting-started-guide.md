## What Is Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI writing assistant built into GitHub. Think of it as a knowledgeable farmhand who has read a lot about farming and can suggest what to write next. When you're creating an Issue, Copilot can draft descriptions, suggest checklists, and help you organize your thoughts --- all from a brief instruction you provide. Copilot does not know your specific farm, so you always review and edit its suggestions before using them. You are the expert; Copilot is the helper.

4. Click inside the **description box**
5. Look for the **Copilot icon** (a sparkle or robot icon) near the text area toolbar
6. Click the icon to open the Copilot panel or chat sidebar
7. Type your prompt (instructions for what you want Copilot to write)
8. Review the generated text, then copy it into the description box if needed

**Other places you may see Copilot:**
- Pull Request descriptions
- Comment boxes on Issues and Pull Requests

## Writing Good Prompts: 5 Tips with Examples

A **prompt** is the instruction you give Copilot to tell it what you need. Better prompts give better results.

### Tip 1: Be Specific

Name the task, the crop, the animal, or the equipment.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|
| "planting" | "spring planting prep for corn and soybeans" |
| "fix tractor" | "annual maintenance checklist for a John Deere 6M tractor" |
| "cows" | "spring vaccination schedule for a 50-head beef cattle herd" |

### Tip 2: Give Context

Mention your farm size, location, season, or operation type.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Write a planting checklist" | "Write a planting checklist for a 40-acre farm in central Illinois" |
| "Equipment maintenance" | "Equipment maintenance for a small dairy farm with 2 tractors and a milking system" |

### Tip 3: Say What Format You Want

Tell Copilot how to structure the output.

**Examples:**
- "Write a checklist with markdown checkboxes"
- "Create a step-by-step plan with numbered steps"
- "Draft an Issue with section headers and a checklist for each section"
- "Use bullet points organized by category"

### Tip 4: Include Key Details

Add dates, quantities, field names, equipment models, or animal types.

**Example prompt with key details:**
> "Write an Issue description for preparing the North Field (20 acres) for spring corn planting by March 15. Include soil testing, seed ordering for Pioneer P1093, planter calibration for 30-inch rows, and herbicide scheduling."

### Tip 5: Ask for What's Missing

If you want a specific section, say so.

**Examples:**
- "Include a section for supplies needed and estimated costs"
- "Add a timeline with target dates for each step"
- "Include a section for notes and observations"
- "Add estimated time for each checklist item"

## Evaluating Copilot Output: Your Review Checklist

After Copilot generates a draft, ask these three questions before accepting anything:

### 1. Is It ACCURATE?

- [ ] Are the facts correct?
- [ ] Are the steps in the right order?
- [ ] Did Copilot suggest anything wrong or made up?
- [ ] Are the technical details correct (product names, measurements, procedures)?

### 2. Is It COMPLETE?

- [ ] Are all the major steps included?
- [ ] Is anything important missing?
- [ ] Is there enough detail for someone else to follow the instructions?
- [ ] Are there sections I need to add (supplies, timeline, notes)?

### 3. Is It RELEVANT to MY Farm?

- [ ] Does it match my specific crops, animals, or equipment?
- [ ] Does it reflect my local conditions and practices?
- [ ] Would these steps actually work on my operation?
- [ ] Is there anything generic that needs to be replaced with my farm's specifics?

**After evaluating:** Keep the good parts, delete what's wrong, add what's missing, and edit the wording to match your farm.

## When to Use Copilot vs. Writing Manually

| Use Copilot When... | Write Manually When... |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| The task description is long and detailed | The task is short and simple |
| You need a structured checklist with many items | You need just a quick note or reminder |
| You know what to do but struggle to write it out | The task is highly specific and only you understand it |
| You want to get past a blank page | You want full control over every word |
| The task is a common farming activity | The task is unique to your operation |
| You want help organizing your thoughts | You already know exactly what to write |

**The best approach for most tasks:** Use Copilot for the first draft, then edit it with your expertise. This combines Copilot's speed with your knowledge.
