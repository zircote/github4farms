## No Device? No Problem

- Ask your instructor about **borrowing a device** during sessions

## Common Questions

### Do I need to know coding?
**No.** Everything uses the GitHub website. No command line, no programming.

### Do I need to pay for GitHub?
**No.** The free account has everything you need.

### What if I forget my password?
Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click "Forgot password?" Use your email to reset it.

### Can I use my phone?
**Yes**, but a laptop or tablet is easier. The phone screen is small for some tasks.

### What if I don't have an email address?
Ask your instructor — they can help you create a free email account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
