# Device-Specific Guides for GitHub

> **Quick Reference for Farmers** --- How to use GitHub on your laptop, tablet, or phone

---

## Laptop / Desktop Computer Guide

### Getting Started

GitHub works best on a laptop or desktop computer with a full web browser. This is the recommended device for all training sessions.

**Recommended browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari (latest version)

### Key Locations on Screen

| What You Need | Where to Find It |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Create new repository/Issue | **+** button, top-right corner |
| Your repositories | Profile avatar (top-right) → **"Your repositories"** |
| Notifications | **Bell icon**, top-right corner |
| Settings | Profile avatar → **"Settings"** |
| Search | **Search bar** at the top of the page, or press **/** |
| Issues tab | Inside a repository, in the **tab bar** below the repo name |
| Projects tab | Inside a repository, or profile avatar → **"Your projects"** |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **/** | Open the search bar |
| **g** then **i** | Go to Issues (when inside a repository) |
| **g** then **p** | Go to Pull Requests |
| **c** | Create a new Issue (when on the Issues page) |
| **Ctrl+Enter** (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) | Submit a comment or Issue |

### Tips for Laptop Users

- Use **bookmarks** to save your most-used repositories for quick access
- Keep GitHub open in its own **browser tab** while you work
- Use **Ctrl+F** (or Cmd+F) to search for text on any page
- Right-click links and select **"Open in new tab"** to keep your current page open

## Tablet Guide (iPad, Android Tablet)

### Getting Started

GitHub works on tablets through the web browser. The mobile GitHub app has limited features, so **use the browser** for the full experience.

**Recommended:** Use your tablet's web browser (Safari on iPad, Chrome on Android) and request the **desktop site** for the best experience.

### How to Request Desktop Site

**iPad (Safari):**
1. Open Safari and go to github.com
2. Tap the **"aA"** icon in the address bar (top-left)
3. Select **"Request Desktop Website"**

**Android tablet (Chrome):**
1. Open Chrome and go to github.com
2. Tap the **three-dot menu** (top-right)
3. Check **"Desktop site"**

### Key Differences on Tablet

| Feature | What's Different |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Typing** | Slower with on-screen keyboard; consider a Bluetooth keyboard |
| **Drag and drop** | Project board columns may require long-press to drag |
| **Right-click menus** | Use long-press instead of right-click |
| **Multiple tabs** | Use your browser's tab feature to keep multiple pages open |
| **File editing** | Works, but the editor is smaller --- pinch to zoom if needed |
| **Copilot** | Works the same as on laptop via the browser |

### Tips for Tablet Users

- Invest in a **Bluetooth keyboard** if you'll use GitHub regularly --- typing is much faster
- Use a **tablet stand** to keep the screen at a comfortable angle
- **Pinch to zoom** on small text or buttons
- Turn the tablet to **landscape orientation** for more screen width
- **Bookmark** your most-used repositories on the home screen for quick access
- If the site looks broken, make sure you're using the **desktop version**

## Phone Guide (iPhone, Android)

### Getting Started

GitHub can be used on a phone, but the screen is small. Phones are best for **checking on things** (notifications, reading Issues) rather than creating content. For creating Issues, setting up Projects, or using Copilot, a larger screen is much easier.

**Two options:**
1. **GitHub Mobile App** (recommended for checking notifications and reading)
2. **Web browser** in desktop mode (needed for Projects, templates, and Copilot)

### GitHub Mobile App

Download from the App Store (iPhone) or Google Play (Android).

**What the app is good for:**
- Reading and responding to notifications
- Viewing and commenting on Issues and Pull Requests
- Quick status checks on your repositories
- Reviewing assigned tasks

**What the app cannot do well:**
- Creating or editing Project boards
- Setting up Issue templates
- Using Copilot (browser only)
- Editing YAML files or workflows
- Complex formatting in Issue descriptions

### Using the Browser on Phone

For features not available in the app, use your phone's browser in desktop mode:

**iPhone (Safari):**
1. Open Safari and go to github.com
2. Tap the **"aA"** icon in the address bar
3. Select **"Request Desktop Website"**

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Open Chrome and go to github.com
2. Tap the **three-dot menu** (top-right)
3. Check **"Desktop site"**

### Key Differences on Phone

| Feature | What's Different |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Screen size** | Everything is smaller --- zoom in frequently |
| **Typing** | Slow for long descriptions; dictate instead if possible |
| **Navigation** | Menus may be hidden behind hamburger icons (three lines) |
| **Projects** | Board view works but columns are narrow; use Table view instead |
| **Copilot** | Works in browser only (not in the app) |
| **File editing** | Possible but difficult; save detailed editing for a computer |

### Tips for Phone Users

- Use the **GitHub Mobile App** for reading and responding --- it's faster than the browser
- Switch to the **browser** (desktop mode) when you need full features
- Use **voice dictation** for typing long descriptions (tap the microphone on your keyboard)
- **Rotate to landscape** for more width on Project boards
- Set up **push notifications** in the app so you don't miss important updates
- Save detailed work (creating Issues, setting up Projects, using Copilot) for when you have access to a **tablet or computer**
- **Bookmark** your repository on your phone's home screen for quick access

## General Device Tips

- **Keep your browser up to date** --- GitHub uses modern web features
- **Use a strong Wi-Fi connection** --- GitHub works poorly on slow or intermittent internet
- **Enable auto-fill** for your GitHub password so you don't have to type it every time
- **Adjust text size** in your browser settings if text is too small
- **If something looks broken**, try refreshing the page or switching to desktop mode

*Start with whatever device you have. As you use GitHub more, you'll find the right device for each task. Most farmers use a laptop for setup and a phone for checking in.*
