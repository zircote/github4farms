3. Scroll down to the **"Features"** section
4. Next to Issues, click **"Set up templates"**

3. Under **"Custom fields"**, click **"New field"**

**Tip:** Spread tasks across iterations rather than putting everything in the first one.

---

## 7. Create a Timeline / Roadmap View

1. Open your Project
2. Click the **"+"** tab (or **"New view"**) at the top
3. Select **"Roadmap"** (this is the Timeline view)
4. Name the view (e.g., "Season Timeline")
5. If Issues don't appear, switch to **Table view** and fill in **date fields** for each Issue
6. Switch back to **Roadmap view** --- Issues should now appear on the timeline

**Tip:** Set dates that match your real farming calendar so the timeline is actually useful.

## 8. Use Copilot to Draft an Issue

1. Click **"New issue"** in your repository
2. Enter a descriptive **title**
3. Click inside the **description box**
4. Look for the **Copilot icon** (sparkle icon) near the text toolbar
5. Click the icon to open Copilot
6. Type a **detailed prompt** describing what you need (be specific about your farm, crops, equipment, or animals)
7. Review the generated text --- check for accuracy, completeness, and relevance
8. **Edit** the draft: delete what's wrong, add what's missing, and adjust for your farm
9. Apply labels and click **"Submit new issue"**

**Tip:** The more detail you put in your prompt, the better the draft. Include farm size, crop types, equipment models, or animal counts.

## 9. Create a Pull Request

1. Make changes on a **branch** (not directly on `main`)
2. Go to the repository's main page
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"** (the yellow banner) or go to the **"Pull requests"** tab and click **"New pull request"**
4. Select the **base branch** (usually `main`) and the **compare branch** (your branch)
5. Enter a **title** and **description** explaining what you changed and why
6. Click **"Create pull request"**
7. Ask a collaborator to **review** your changes
8. Once approved, click **"Merge pull request"**

**Tip:** Write your PR description as if explaining the change to a fellow farmer who hasn't seen it yet.

## 10. Watch a Repository for Notifications

1. Open the repository you want to follow
2. Click the **"Watch"** button near the top-right (next to Star and Fork)
3. Choose your notification level:

   - **All Activity** --- every Issue, PR, and comment
   - **Custom** --- choose specific events
4. Check notifications by clicking the **bell icon** in the top-right corner of GitHub

**Tip:** Start with "Participating and @mentions" to avoid notification overload. Increase later if needed.
