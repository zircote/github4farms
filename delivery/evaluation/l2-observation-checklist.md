# Skills Observation Checklist

## L2 — Learning (Instructor Observation Checklist)

**Purpose**: Document observable skill demonstrations during hands-on practice to verify learning transfer.

**Administration**: Complete during or immediately after each session. Focus on whether learners can independently perform target skills with minimal prompting.

---

## Instructions for Instructors

1. **Timing**: Observe during hands-on practice periods (typically last 15-20 minutes of session)
2. **Scoring**: Mark one checkbox per skill per learner:
   - **Demonstrated**: Completed independently with minimal or no instructor support
   - **Needed Help**: Required significant prompting, correction, or instructor intervention
   - **Not Attempted**: Did not attempt skill during observation period
3. **Notes**: Record specific challenges or teaching moments for future reference
4. **Privacy**: Keep checklists confidential; use for instructional improvement only

## Scoring Interpretation

### Individual Learner Assessment

**Proficiency Levels**:
- **Independent (80-100% demonstrated)**: Learner can perform skills without support
- **Developing (50-79% demonstrated)**: Learner understands concepts but needs practice
- **Needs Support (below 50% demonstrated)**: Learner requires additional instruction

**Action Thresholds**:
- **3+ "Needed Help" in single session**: Schedule 1-on-1 review before next session
- **2+ "Not Attempted"**: Check for disengagement, technology barriers, or confidence issues
- **Consistent "Needed Help" across sessions**: Consider pairing with peer mentor

### Cohort-Level Assessment

**Healthy Indicators**:
- 70%+ of learners demonstrate each skill independently
- Less than 20% "Not Attempted" for core skills
- "Needed Help" percentage decreases over time as learners build confidence

**Warning Signs**:
- Less than 50% demonstrate any single skill — indicates pacing or clarity issue
- High "Not Attempted" rates — may indicate technology access issues or disengagement
- No improvement in "Needed Help" rates over sessions — instructional approach may need adjustment

## Cross-Reference with L1 Feedback

Compare observation data with L1 Session Feedback Survey results:

| L1 Signal | L2 Validation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Q4 (Confidence) < 3.5 | Should correlate with higher "Needed Help" rates |
| Q7 (Most confusing) themes | Should correlate with skills showing lower demonstration rates |
| Q3 (Enough practice time) low | Should correlate with higher "Not Attempted" rates |

**Actionable Insight**: If L1 confidence is high but L2 observation shows low skill demonstration, learners may be overestimating their abilities. Add more formative assessment.

## Administration Tips

1. **Observation strategy**: Focus on 3-4 learners per session for detailed observation; rotate focus across cohort
2. **Real-time capture**: Use paper checklist during session; digitize notes afterward
3. **Avoid disruption**: Observe naturally during practice; don't interrupt learner flow
4. **Neutral marking**: "Needed Help" is not failure — it's valuable diagnostic data
5. **Peer learning**: Note when learners help each other (positive indicator of mastery)
6. **Technology issues**: Distinguish between skill gaps and technology barriers (WiFi, device issues)

## Data Privacy and Storage

- Store completed checklists in secure location (locked file or password-protected digital folder)
- Do not share individual learner data without consent
- Use aggregated cohort data for program evaluation and improvement
- Retain for 12 months; destroy after retention period per institutional policy
