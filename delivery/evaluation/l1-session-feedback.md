## Scoring Guide for Instructors

### Quantitative Analysis

**Per Session**:
1. Calculate average score for each Likert-scale question (questions 1-4)
2. Calculate overall session average (mean of questions 1-4)
3. Count pacing responses (distribution across Too Slow / Just Right / Too Fast)

**Interpretation**:
- **4.0 - 5.0**: Excellent — session met or exceeded expectations
- **3.5 - 3.9**: Good — session was effective, minor adjustments may help
- **Below 3.5**: Needs attention — identify specific issues and adjust delivery

**Flag for immediate review**:
- Any individual question averaging below 3.5
- More than 30% of learners selecting "Too Fast" or "Too Slow"
- Question 4 (confidence) scoring below 3.5 indicates practice time or clarity issues

### Qualitative Analysis

**Questions 6-7 (Useful / Confusing)**:
- Identify recurring themes across multiple learners
- Cross-reference with observation checklist (L2) to validate learning gaps
- Use insights to adjust pacing, examples, or practice time in future sessions

**Question 8 (Open comments)**:
- Track facility issues (WiFi, visibility, comfort)
- Note requests for additional resources
- Identify peer learning dynamics

### Trend Tracking

Compare scores across sessions to identify:
- Cumulative fatigue (declining scores over weeks)
- Topics that consistently challenge learners (lower Q4 confidence scores)
- Instructor improvement over time (rising scores with same content)

### Recommended Action Thresholds

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Q4 (confidence) < 3.5 for 2+ consecutive sessions | Increase practice time; add remedial session |
| Q2 (farm examples) < 4.0 | Revise examples to match local context |
| 40%+ select "Too Fast" | Split session into two parts or reduce scope |
| Recurring confusion in Q7 | Add visual aids or simplify explanation |

## Administration Tips

1. **Timing**: Reserve last 5 minutes of session for survey completion
2. **Anonymity**: Emphasize that name is optional to encourage honest feedback
3. **Consistency**: Use same form for all 12 sessions to enable comparison
4. **Digital option**: Consider Google Forms or Microsoft Forms for remote learners
5. **Response rate**: Aim for 90%+ completion; follow up with non-respondents
6. **Review cadence**: Review scores within 24 hours while session is fresh
