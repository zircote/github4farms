# Farm Outcome Tracking Template

## L4 — Results (Farm Outcome Tracking)

**Purpose**: Measure the tangible operational and economic impact of GitHub adoption on farm management and productivity.

**Administration**: Collect data at 6 months and 12 months post-training. Combine self-reported data with observable GitHub activity metrics where possible.

---

## Overview

Level 4 evaluation measures the ultimate value of training: does GitHub improve farm operations and business outcomes? This requires both quantitative metrics (GitHub activity, time saved) and qualitative assessment (operational changes, satisfaction).

**Key Questions**:
1. Are farmers actively using GitHub for farm management?
2. Has GitHub saved time or improved organization?
3. Has training created a multiplier effect through peer teaching?
4. What is the return on investment (ROI) for training delivery?

## Data Collection Intervals

- **6-Month Assessment**: Early results; habits established
- **12-Month Assessment**: Long-term sustainability; full ROI picture

## Metric 1: GitHub Activity Metrics

### Data Sources

**For Public Repositories** (can be collected via GitHub API or manual observation):
- Number of active repositories per farmer
- Number of Issues created and closed
- Number of Project boards created and updated
- Number of commits made
- Number of collaborators added
- Number of workflow runs (GitHub Actions)

**For Private Repositories**: Request self-reported data or aggregate anonymized stats if farmers consent.

### Collection Template

**Farmer Name**: _________________________________ **Assessment Date**: _______________

**Months Since Training**: [ ] 6 [ ] 12

| Metric | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Active repositories | ___ | |
| Total Issues created | ___ | |
| Issues currently open | ___ | |
| Issues closed | ___ | |
| Project boards in use | ___ | |
| Collaborators added | ___ | (Employees, partners, family) |
| GitHub Actions workflows | ___ | |
| Last activity date | _______ | (Recency indicator) |

**Activity Status**: [ ] Active (weekly use) [ ] Occasional (monthly use) [ ] Dormant (no recent activity)

### Interpretation

**Healthy Indicators**:
- 2+ active repositories per farmer
- 10+ Issues created within 6 months
- At least 1 Project board actively maintained
- 1+ collaborators (indicates team usage)
- Activity within last 14 days

**Warning Signs**:
- Zero activity in last 60 days (dormancy risk)
- Single repository with <5 Issues (limited adoption)
- No collaborators (solo use only, missing collaboration value)

## Metric 6: Return on Investment (ROI)

### ROI Calculation Framework

**Cost Side (Training Investment)**:
- Instructor time: _____ hours × $_____ /hour = $_____
- Materials and facility: $_____
- Learner time (opportunity cost): _____ farmers × _____ hours × $_____ /hour = $_____
- **Total Training Cost**: $_____

**Benefit Side (Value Generated)**:

**Time Savings Value**:
- Average time saved per farmer per week: _____ hours
- Number of farmers actively using GitHub: _____
- Hourly value of farmer time: $_____ /hour
- Weeks per year: 52
- **Annual time savings value** = Avg hours saved × Active farmers × Hourly value × 52 weeks
- **Annual time savings value**: $_____

**Operational Value** (estimate based on qualitative impact):
- Reduced errors (avoided losses): $_____
- Improved planning (yield/efficiency gains): $_____
- Enhanced collaboration (productivity gains): $_____
- **Total operational value**: $_____

**Total Annual Benefit**: $_____ (Time savings + Operational value)

**ROI Calculation**:
- **ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Total Training Cost) / Total Training Cost × 100%**
- **ROI**: _____%

**Payback Period**: Total Training Cost / Total Annual Benefit = _____ years

### Example ROI Calculation

**Scenario**: 10-farmer cohort, 12-month assessment

**Costs**:
- Instructor: 60 hours × $50/hour = $3,000
- Materials: $500
- Learner time: 10 farmers × 24 hours × $25/hour = $6,000
- **Total Cost**: $9,500

**Benefits**:
- Time savings: 3 hours/week × 8 active farmers × $25/hour × 52 weeks = $31,200
- Operational improvements (estimated): $5,000
- **Total Annual Benefit**: $36,200

**ROI**: ($36,200 - $9,500) / $9,500 × 100% = **281%**

**Payback Period**: $9,500 / $36,200 = **0.26 years (3 months)**

### Interpretation

**Positive ROI (>0%)**: Training generates more value than cost
**100%+ ROI**: Training pays for itself and generates additional value
**Payback <1 year**: Strong business case for training investment

**Conservative Estimate**: Use lower bound of time savings and exclude hard-to-quantify operational benefits for conservative ROI.

## Data Collection Protocol

### 6-Month Assessment

**Methods**:
1. **GitHub Activity**: Review public repos or request self-reported data
2. **Time Savings**: Email survey or phone interview
3. **Collaboration**: Survey question
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Survey question
5. **Qualitative Impact**: Phone interview or open-ended survey

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes per farmer

### 12-Month Assessment

**Methods**: Same as 6-month, plus:
1. **ROI Calculation**: Aggregate cohort data
2. **Case Studies**: Select 2-3 high-impact farmers for detailed case study
3. **Sustainability Check**: Assess whether usage has increased, plateaued, or declined since 6-month mark

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes per farmer

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Consent**: Obtain permission before viewing public GitHub repositories
2. **Privacy**: Do not share individual farm data without explicit consent
3. **Anonymization**: Use aggregated data for reporting; anonymize quotes
4. **Voluntary**: Participation in outcome tracking is voluntary; non-participation does not affect future training access

## Using Results for Program Improvement

### Strong Results (ROI >100%, 70%+ active users)
- **Action**: Document success stories; expand program to new cohorts
- **Share**: Publish case studies; present at conferences

### Moderate Results (ROI 50-100%, 40-70% active users)
- **Action**: Identify barriers for inactive users; offer refresher training
- **Improve**: Adjust curriculum based on low-adoption features

### Weak Results (ROI <50%, <40% active users)
- **Action**: Conduct root cause analysis; interview non-users
- **Reassess**: Consider whether GitHub is appropriate tool for target audience
- **Redesign**: Revise curriculum, delivery method, or follow-up support

### Longitudinal Tracking

**Compare 6-month and 12-month data**:
- **Increasing activity**: Sustainable adoption, skills reinforcing over time
- **Stable activity**: Plateau reached, usage normalized
- **Declining activity**: Erosion of skills or motivation; intervention needed

## Appendix: GitHub Activity Data Collection Script

For programs with technical capacity, automate data collection using GitHub API:

### Prerequisites
- GitHub Personal Access Token (read-only, public_repo scope)
- List of farmer GitHub usernames
- Python 3.x with `requests` library

### Sample Script Structure

```python
# Sample pseudocode - not production-ready
import requests

GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
USERNAMES = ["farmer1", "farmer2", "farmer3"]

for username in USERNAMES:
    repos = get_user_repos(username, token=GITHUB_TOKEN)
    for repo in repos:
        issues = get_repo_issues(repo, token=GITHUB_TOKEN)
        projects = get_repo_projects(repo, token=GITHUB_TOKEN)
        # Aggregate metrics
        print(f"{username}: {len(repos)} repos, {len(issues)} issues")
```

**Important**: Only collect data from public repositories or with explicit consent for private repos.
