# GitHub Usage Follow-Up Survey

## L3 — Behavior (30/60/90-Day Follow-Up Survey)

**Purpose**: Measure whether learners are applying GitHub skills in their daily farm operations after training completion.

**Administration**: Conduct at 30, 60, and 90 days post-training via email, phone interview, or in-person visit. Track response rates and follow up with non-respondents.

## Scoring and Interpretation Guide

### Metric 1: Adoption Rate

**Question 1 (Usage Frequency)**

Calculate percentage of respondents in each category:

| Frequency | Target | Action if Below Target |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| Daily/Weekly | 60%+ | Strong adoption — no action needed |
| Monthly | 20-30% | Moderate adoption — offer refresher |
| Rarely/Not at all | Below 20% | Poor adoption — investigate barriers |

**Red Flag**: If >30% report "Not at all" or "Rarely", training may not be translating to real-world use.

### Metric 2: Feature Utilization

**Question 2 (Active Features)**

Count average number of features checked per respondent:

- **5+ features**: High utilization — learner is power user
- **3-4 features**: Moderate utilization — core skills retained
- **1-2 features**: Low utilization — limited application
- **0 features**: Non-adoption — requires intervention

**Most Critical Features** (prioritize these in analysis):
- Repositories (foundational)
- Issues (primary use case for farmers)
- Projects (organizational value)

### Metric 3: Knowledge Multiplier

**Question 3 (Taught Others)**

- **Target**: 30%+ of learners teach at least one other person by 90-day mark
- **Multiplier Effect**: Each peer teacher extends reach of training
- **Action**: If <20% teach others, consider adding "train-the-trainer" incentives

### Metric 4: Barrier Analysis

**Question 4 (Barriers Encountered)**

Identify top 3 barriers and prioritize solutions:

| Barrier | Potential Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Forgot how to do tasks | Create quick-reference guides; offer refresher webinar |
| Lack of time | Emphasize time-saving benefits; provide micro-tutorials |
| No internet access | Offer offline resources; GitHub Desktop training |
| Difficult to adapt examples | Provide more diverse farm type examples |
| No one else uses it | Build farmer community of practice |
| Technology issues | Provide technical support contact |

### Metric 5: Impact Score

**Question 6 (Changed Operations)**

- **Target Average**: 3.5+ out of 5 by 90-day mark
- **4-5 ratings**: Demonstrate tangible operational value
- **1-2 ratings**: Suggest limited real-world relevance or adoption barriers

**Qualitative Analysis**: Code open-ended responses for themes:
- Time savings
- Better organization
- Improved collaboration
- Reduced errors
- Enhanced planning

### Metric 6: Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**Question 7 (Likelihood to Recommend)**

**NPS Calculation**:
- **Promoters** (9-10): Enthusiastic supporters
- **Passives** (7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic
- **Detractors** (0-6): Unlikely to recommend

**NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors**

**Interpretation**:
- **Above +50**: Excellent — strong program value
- **+30 to +50**: Good — most learners see value
- **0 to +30**: Needs improvement — mixed results
- **Below 0**: Poor — more detractors than promoters

## Administration Instructions

### Timing

- **30 Days**: Initial behavior assessment; learners still remember training
- **60 Days**: Mid-term check; patterns emerging
- **90 Days**: Sustained behavior assessment; habits forming or fading

### Delivery Methods

**Email Survey** (Recommended for scalability)
- Use Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, or SurveyMonkey
- Send personalized email with survey link
- Follow up 1 week after initial send if no response
- Estimated completion time: 5-7 minutes

**Phone Interview** (Best for qualitative depth)
- Schedule 10-15 minute call
- Use survey as interview script
- Record notes directly on form
- Allows probing for detail on open-ended questions

**In-Person Visit** (Ideal for farm-based programs)
- Conduct during regular farm visit or field day
- Complete survey conversational interview style
- Observe GitHub usage on learner's device if possible
- Opportunity to provide just-in-time support

### Follow-Up Protocol

**Non-Respondents**:
1. Send reminder email 7 days after initial contact
2. Attempt phone contact 14 days after initial contact
3. Final attempt at 21 days
4. Mark as non-response after 3 attempts

**Low Usage Respondents** (Rarely/Not at all):
1. Conduct brief phone interview to understand barriers
2. Offer refresher session or resources
3. Connect with peer mentor if available
4. Document reasons for non-adoption

**High Usage Respondents** (Daily/Weekly):
1. Request permission to use as case study
2. Invite to share success story with cohort
3. Consider as candidate for peer mentor or train-the-trainer
