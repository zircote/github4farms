# Instructor Quick Start

> Get ready to deliver your first GitHub for Farmers session in 5 steps.

## Before You Begin

- You should have access to the curriculum repository
- Allow 2-3 hours for initial setup before your first cohort

---

## Step 1: Set Up the Demo Environment (1-2 hours)

The training uses a GitHub organization with demo repositories. You need:

| Repository | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `github4farms-training` | Primary training repo used in all 12 sessions |
| `sunrise-acres-example` | Completed example showing full implementation |
| `template-starter` | Minimal template learners fork in Session 12 |
| `instructor-notes` | Private repo with answer keys and setup scripts |

**Option A: Use the pre-built environment**
- Request access to `github4farms-training` organization
- Verify you have Owner permissions

**Option B: Create your own environment**
- Follow the complete setup in [delivery/demo-environment-spec.md](./delivery/demo-environment-spec.md)

---

## Step 2: Prepare Session Materials (30 min)

For each session you'll deliver:

1. **Open the slide deck** — `sessions/session-NN/slides.pptx`
2. **Review the facilitation script** — `sessions/session-NN/facilitation-script.md`
3. **Test the lab exercise** — Walk through `sessions/session-NN/lab-exercise.md` yourself
4. **Print handouts** — See the print matrix in [delivery/logistics-checklist.md](./delivery/logistics-checklist.md)

**Tip:** Run through Session 1 completely before your first delivery. The facilitation script includes exact timing and talking points.

---

## Step 3: Collect Learner Information (1 week before)

You need each learner's:

- [ ] Full name (for certificates)
- [ ] Email address
- [ ] GitHub username (they create accounts at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup))

**Recommended username format:** `firstname-lastname-farm` (e.g., `john-smith-farm`)

Send organization invitations via GitHub:
1. Go to your organization > People > Invite member
2. Enter their GitHub username
3. Set role to "Member"

Invitations expire in 7 days — send reminders!

---

## Step 4: Verify Environment (Day before Session 1)

Use the verification checklist in [delivery/demo-environment-spec.md](./delivery/demo-environment-spec.md#7-verification-checklist-pre-cohort):

- [ ] `github4farms-training` is public and has 8+ Issues
- [ ] All learners accepted organization invitations
- [ ] Projector/screen sharing works with slide deck
- [ ] You can access all demo repositories

---

## Step 5: Deliver Session 1

**Session 1 is read-only** — learners browse `github4farms-training` without making changes.

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Opening | 15 min | Welcome, introductions, farm analogies |
| Instruction | 45 min | Navigate repository, find files, understand structure |
| Practice | 60 min | Lab exercise exploring `github4farms-training` |
| Wrap-up | 15 min | Reflection, preview Session 2 |

**Don't forget:**
- Farm analogies ground every concept (repository = digital barn)
- 60-70% of time should be hands-on practice
- Use the troubleshooting section in facilitation script
