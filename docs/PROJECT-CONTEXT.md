# Project Context

## Problem Statement

Farmers with no prior technical experience need to adopt GitHub as a platform for farm data management, team collaboration, grant/compliance tracking, and broader digital literacy. A cohort of 1–25 farmers currently lacks any structured pathway to learn GitHub, resulting in missed opportunities for organized project tracking, automated workflows, and modern collaboration practices. The quantified impact of this gap is not yet measured but spans hours lost to manual processes, collaboration failures, and unmet compliance reporting potential.

## Domain / Industry

**Education — Digital Literacy for Agriculture**

A technology onboarding and training curriculum targeting the agriculture sector, focused on building GitHub proficiency from zero technical background to independent, productive use.

## Stakeholders

- **Curriculum Developer / Instructor (Project Owner)**: Sole creator, organizer, and deliverer of all training materials and sessions. Responsible for syllabus design, content development, and in-person instruction.
- **Farmer Learners (1–25)**: Primary audience with no prior technical experience. Participants across the full curriculum who need to achieve GitHub proficiency for practical farm operations.

## Constraints

- **Budget**: No allocated budget — this is a volunteer effort using free tools and personal time.
- **Timeline**: 3–6 months to develop and begin delivering the curriculum.
- **Sessions**: 8–12 training sessions covering the full curriculum arc from basics to advanced features.
- **Team size**: 1 person (instructor/developer) delivering to 1–25 learners.
- **Compliance**: Materials must meet ADA/Section 508 accessibility standards.
- **Technology**: Mixed/TBD device environment — learners may use personal laptops, shared computers, tablets, or phones. Materials must accommodate varied device access.
- **Delivery format**: In-person sessions preferred.
- **Seasonal**: Training schedule must accommodate agricultural seasons (planting, harvest) when farmers are unavailable.

## Available Data

- **Primary reference**: The `../github` repository containing:
  - Comprehensive guides and best practices documentation (`docs/COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/GITHUB_ECOSYSTEM_BEST_PRACTICES.md`, `docs/ADOPTION.md`)
  - Research briefs on GitHub ecosystem, Copilot, and content automation (`docs/research/`)
  - Organization-level GitHub configuration (actions, agents, labels, contributing guidelines, security policies) (`org-github/`)
  - 15+ project templates spanning multiple languages and use cases (`templates/`)
  - Troubleshooting guides and gotchas (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/GOTCHAS_AND_TIPS.md`)
  - Use cases and case studies (`docs/USE_CASES.md`, `docs/case-studies/`)
- **No prior training materials, audience surveys, or existing slide decks** — curriculum is built from scratch.

## Desired Outcomes

### Minimum Viable Outcome
- Farmers can independently navigate the GitHub web interface (browse repositories, read files, understand layout)
- Farmers can create, manage, and comment on Issues
- Farmers can use GitHub Projects to track work and organize tasks
- Farmers can collaborate with others on shared repositories without hand-holding

### Stretch / Ideal Outcome
- Farmers confidently use GitHub Actions and automated workflows for farm operations
- Farmers leverage GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted work
- Farmers understand and can use GitHub Spark and Agents features
- Farmers become self-sufficient power users who can teach peers (train-the-trainer potential)
- Farmers independently create and manage their own repositories for farm projects

### Deliverables (This Project)
- Complete multi-session syllabus (8–12 sessions)
- Session plans with learning objectives, timing, and activities
- Slide decks for each session
- Hands-on exercises and lab worksheets
- Project templates tailored to farming use cases
- Quick-reference guides / cheat sheets
- Assessment materials to measure learner progress
- Supporting documentation as needs emerge

## Additional Context

- **Tech anxiety is a significant factor**: Learners are expected to have resistance or anxiety about using technology. The curriculum must be designed with patience, repetition, and confidence-building in mind — progressive complexity with frequent wins.
- **Seasonal scheduling**: Training sessions must work around planting and harvest seasons when farmers are unavailable. The curriculum should be designed in modular blocks that can accommodate gaps.
- **In-person delivery**: Sessions are designed for in-person delivery, not remote. Materials should support a classroom/workshop setting with live demonstration and guided practice.
- **GitHub features to cover across the curriculum**:
  1. Repositories (navigation, structure, files)
  2. Issues (creation, labels, assignment, discussion)
  3. Projects (boards, views, tracking)
  4. Actions and Workflows (automation basics)
  5. GitHub Spark
  6. GitHub Copilot and Agents
  7. General collaboration (pull requests, discussions, notifications)
- **Zero-to-hero progression**: The curriculum must assume absolutely no prior experience with GitHub, version control, or developer tooling. Start from "what is a repository" and build incrementally.
