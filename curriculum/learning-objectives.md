2. **Create** a new Issue with a descriptive title, detailed description, and at least one photo attachment relevant to a farm task
3. **Apply** labels to Issues to categorize farm tasks (equipment, livestock, crops, maintenance, urgent) and assign an Issue to themselves

---

## Session 6: Basic Workflows & Templates

**Bloom's Level:** Apply / Analyze
**Theme:** "Building reusable processes so you never start from scratch"

2. **Use** a saved reply to respond to a recurring question or status update efficiently
3. **Apply** a project board template to set up a new seasonal planning board without manual configuration
4. **Differentiate** between Issue Templates, Project Templates, and Repository Templates and describe when each is useful
5. **Design** a set of 2–3 Issue Templates tailored to their own farm's most common recurring tasks

---

## Session 7: Introduction to GitHub Actions

**Bloom's Level:** Analyze / Evaluate
**Theme:** "Automatic farm helpers that work while you sleep"

1. **Describe** what GitHub Actions are using the farm analogy ("automatic helpers that do tasks on a schedule or when something happens")
2. **Navigate** to the Actions tab of a repository and identify the status of a workflow run (success, failure, in progress)
3. **Read** a simple YAML workflow file and identify its key components: trigger event, job name, and steps (without writing YAML)
4. **Evaluate** a pre-built workflow's output to determine whether it ran successfully and what it accomplished
5. **Identify** 3 farm tasks that could benefit from automation and explain which trigger type (schedule, event, manual) would be appropriate for each

---

## Session 8: Automating Farm Tasks

**Bloom's Level:** Evaluate / Apply
**Theme:** "Setting up your first automated workflow"

1. **Enable** a starter workflow template in a repository by selecting it from the Actions marketplace and committing it
2. **Customize** a scheduled workflow by modifying the cron schedule (e.g., changing from daily to weekly) using the web editor
3. **Verify** that an automated workflow runs correctly by checking the Actions tab for successful execution and reviewing the output
4. **Troubleshoot** a failed workflow run by reading the error log and identifying the cause of failure
5. **Create** a working automated reminder workflow that creates a weekly Issue for a recurring farm task (e.g., "Weekly Equipment Check")

---

## Session 9: Advanced Projects & Roadmaps

**Bloom's Level:** Analyze / Evaluate
**Theme:** "Seeing your whole season at a glance"

1. **Add** custom fields (date, dropdown, number) to a GitHub Project to capture farm-specific data (crop type, field name, expected yield)
2. **Configure** iterations in a Project to represent planting windows, growing periods, or harvest weeks
3. **Build** a seasonal roadmap using the Timeline view that spans 6+ months with milestones for key farm activities
4. **Link** Issues from multiple repositories into a single Project to create cross-functional farm visibility
5. **Evaluate** a completed Project roadmap and identify scheduling conflicts, resource bottlenecks, or missing dependencies

---

## Session 10: GitHub Copilot Basics

**Bloom's Level:** Evaluate / Create
**Theme:** "Your AI assistant for farm task writing"

1. **Describe** what GitHub Copilot is and how it assists with drafting text, using the analogy of "a knowledgeable helper who suggests what to write next"
2. **Use** Copilot to generate a draft Issue description for a farm task by providing a brief prompt (e.g., "spring planting prep checklist")
3. **Evaluate** Copilot's output for accuracy, completeness, and relevance to their specific farm context
4. **Edit** a Copilot-generated draft to customize it for their farm's specific needs, adding or removing items as appropriate
5. **Compare** the time and quality of creating a task description manually vs. using Copilot assistance, and articulate when AI help is most valuable
