# Learner Needs Assessment — Learner Profile

> **Assessment Method:** Proxy analysis based on agricultural extension educator research, USDA rural technology surveys, and domain literature on digital literacy in farming communities.
>
> **Date:** 2026-01-30
>
> **Note:** Direct farmer surveys should be conducted with the actual cohort prior to Session 1 delivery. This proxy analysis establishes baseline assumptions for curriculum design. Update this document with real data when available.

## 1. Cohort Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cohort size | 1–25 farmers |
| Geographic context | Rural United States |
| Prior GitHub experience | None |
| Prior version control experience | None |
| Prior technical/developer experience | None to minimal |
| Age range (estimated) | 25–65+ |
| Education | Mixed — high school diploma through bachelor's degree; no technical degrees expected |

---

## 2. Technology Access Breakdown

Based on USDA Economic Research Service data and rural broadband reports, the following device and connectivity profile is assumed:

| Device Type | Estimated Ownership | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Smartphone | 85–95% | Primary personal device; Android and iPhone mix |
| Laptop/Desktop | 50–65% | Often shared household computer; may be older hardware |
| Tablet | 15–30% | Less common; some use iPad for farm management apps |
| Reliable home broadband | 55–70% | Rural broadband gaps persist; some rely on cellular data |
| Mobile hotspot / cellular data | 75–90% | Often the primary or backup internet connection |

**Key Insight:** Smartphones are the most universally available device. However, GitHub's web interface is optimized for desktop/laptop use. The curriculum must be designed primarily for laptop/desktop with explicit mobile accommodation notes. Training venue must provide reliable Wi-Fi or backup hotspot.

### Device Strategy for Training Sessions

- **Primary:** Laptop/desktop at training venue (provide loaner devices if needed)
- **Secondary:** Personal smartphones for between-session practice
- **Backup:** Printed quick-reference guides for offline review

## 3. Skill Level Distribution

| Skill Level | Estimated % of Cohort | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| No tech experience | 20–30% | Uses phone for calls/texts only; minimal app use; no email or web browsing habits |
| Basic digital literacy | 40–50% | Uses smartphone apps (weather, market prices), email, basic web browsing; comfortable with touchscreens |
| Moderate digital literacy | 20–30% | Uses spreadsheets, farm management software (e.g., Bushel, FarmLogs), online banking; comfortable learning new apps |
| Advanced | 0–5% | Has used project management tools, cloud storage, or collaborative platforms; rare in this cohort |

**Key Insight:** The majority (60–80%) have basic-to-no digital skills. Curriculum must start at absolute zero — "What is a website?" level — and build incrementally. Assume nothing about browser navigation, account creation, or typing proficiency.

## 4. Seasonal Availability Map

Agricultural seasons directly constrain training scheduling. The following calendar reflects typical temperate-zone U.S. farming:

| Month | Availability | Farm Activity |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| January | HIGH | Winter downtime; equipment maintenance, planning |
| February | HIGH | Pre-season planning, seed ordering |
| March | MEDIUM-HIGH | Early planting prep; some field work begins |
| April | MEDIUM | Planting begins for cool-season crops |
| May | LOW | Peak planting season — unavailable |
| June | LOW | Planting completion, early cultivation — unavailable |
| July | MEDIUM-HIGH | Mid-season maintenance; less intensive |
| August | MEDIUM | Late-season tasks; harvest prep begins |
| September | LOW | Harvest season begins — unavailable |
| October | LOW | Peak harvest — unavailable |
| November | MEDIUM-HIGH | Post-harvest; equipment winterization |
| December | HIGH | Winter downtime |

### Recommended Training Blocks

| Block | Months | Sessions | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Block 1 | March–April | Sessions 1–4 | Start before planting intensifies |
| Block 2 | July–August | Sessions 5–8 | Mid-season window |
| Block 3 | November–December | Sessions 9–12 | Post-harvest downtime |

**Blackout Periods:** May–June (planting), September–October (harvest)

**Key Insight:** Training must be delivered in 3 discrete blocks with 8–10 week gaps. Recap sessions are essential at the start of Blocks 2 and 3 to rebuild knowledge after seasonal breaks. Asynchronous resources (refresher one-pagers, optional GitHub Discussion prompts) should bridge the gaps.

## 5. Learning Preferences

Based on adult learning research (Knowles' Andragogy) and agricultural extension education models:

| Preference | Strength in This Cohort | Curriculum Implication |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Hands-on / experiential** | Very strong | 60–70% of session time must be guided practice |
| **Visual** | Strong | Use screenshots, diagrams, live demos; avoid text-heavy slides |
| **Social / peer-based** | Strong | Pair work, group exercises; farmers learn well from peers |
| **Problem-centered** | Very strong | Every concept must connect to a real farm problem |
| **Self-paced** | Moderate | Some prefer to work ahead; provide stretch challenges |
| **Lecture / reading** | Weak | Minimize lecture to 15–20 minutes max per session; avoid reading-heavy materials |
| **Abstract / theoretical** | Very weak | Never present GitHub concepts in developer/abstract terms; always use farm analogies |

**Key Insight:** Farmers are pragmatic learners. Every concept must answer "How does this help my farm?" within the first 2 minutes of introduction. Agricultural analogies (repository = barn, issue = work order, commit = field log entry) are essential for building mental models.

## 6. Technology Anxiety Indicators

Technology anxiety is the single highest-rated risk for this project (Risk R-001, score 9/9). Expected indicators:

| Indicator | Expected Prevalence | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Fear of "breaking something" | 60–80% | Emphasize that GitHub is reversible; demonstrate undo; use sandbox repos |
| Intimidation by technical jargon | 70–90% | Replace all jargon with farm analogies; provide glossary |
| Self-doubt ("I'm not a tech person") | 50–70% | Celebrate every small win; normalize mistakes; share instructor's own learning journey |
| Frustration with unfamiliar interfaces | 40–60% | Slow pacing; frequent check-ins; "raise your hand" culture; paired exercises |
| Reluctance to ask questions | 30–50% | Anonymous question cards; pair discussions before whole-group Q&A |
| Drop-out risk after first difficulty | 20–40% | Build early wins in Session 1; make Session 1 entirely success-oriented |

**Key Insight:** Session 1 must be an overwhelmingly positive experience. Design it so that every learner leaves having successfully completed a visible task (e.g., "I navigated a repository and found a file"). First impressions determine retention.

## 7. Accessibility Needs

| Need | Expected Prevalence | Accommodation |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Vision (reading small text, low contrast) | 15–25% (age-related) | 18pt+ fonts, high contrast, screen zoom guidance |
| Hearing (difficulty in group settings) | 10–20% (age-related) | Visual reinforcement of all verbal instructions; captioned videos |
| Motor (difficulty with mouse/trackpad) | 5–10% | Keyboard shortcuts guide; touch-friendly exercises |
| Cognitive (information overload) | 40–60% (context-related) | Limit new concepts per session (3–5 max); frequent breaks; chunked content |
| Language | 5–15% | Plain language (grade 6–8 reading level); avoid idioms; provide glossary |

**Key Insight:** Cognitive overload is the most widespread accessibility concern — not because of disability, but because the content domain is entirely new. Limit each session to 3–5 new concepts maximum. Use the "rule of three": introduce, practice, reinforce.

## 8. Motivation and Value Drivers

Understanding what motivates farmers to attend (and keep attending) is critical for retention:

| Motivator | Strength | How to Leverage |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Immediate practical value** | Very strong | Every session produces something useful for the farm |
| **Saving time on existing tasks** | Strong | Show before/after: manual tracking vs. GitHub Projects |
| **Peer community** | Strong | Foster cohort identity; pair exercises; celebrate group milestones |
| **Grant/compliance requirements** | Moderate | Show how GitHub creates audit trails for grant reporting |
| **Curiosity about technology** | Moderate | Feed curiosity with "did you know" moments about GitHub features |
| **Certificate or credential** | Low-moderate | Consider completion certificate; not a primary driver |
| **Career advancement** | Low | Not relevant for most; some younger farmers may value it |

## 9. Survey Instrument (For Actual Cohort)

The following survey should be administered to the actual farmer cohort before Session 1 to validate or update this proxy analysis:

### Pre-Training Survey Questions

**Technology Access**
1. What devices do you use regularly? (Check all: smartphone, laptop, desktop, tablet, none)
2. What type of internet do you have at home? (Broadband, cellular/hotspot, satellite, dial-up, none)
3. How would you rate your internet reliability? (Always works / Usually works / Often drops / Rarely works)

**Technology Experience**
4. Which of these have you used? (Check all: email, web browser, smartphone apps, spreadsheets, cloud storage, social media, online banking, none)
5. Have you ever used a project management tool? (Yes — which one? / No)
6. How comfortable are you learning new technology? (Very comfortable / Somewhat comfortable / Nervous but willing / Very anxious)

**Seasonal Availability**
7. Which months are you busiest on the farm? (Check all that apply)
8. What day of the week works best for training? (Weekday / Weekend / Either)
9. What time of day works best? (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)

**Learning Preferences**
10. How do you prefer to learn new things? (Rank: Hands-on practice / Watching someone demo / Reading instructions / Group discussion)
11. Do you have any accessibility needs we should know about? (Vision, hearing, mobility, language, other)

**Motivation**
12. What farm tasks do you find most time-consuming or frustrating?
13. What would make this training worth your time?
