## Blackout Periods

| Period | Months | Reason | Duration |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Planting Season | May–June | Peak field work; planting, cultivation, early crop management | 8–9 weeks |
| Harvest Season | September–October | Peak harvest, post-harvest processing, market delivery | 8–9 weeks |

These blackout periods are based on temperate-zone U.S. farming calendars. Adjust for local growing conditions and crop types.

## Training Blocks

### Block 1: Foundation (March–April)

**Sessions:** 1–4
**Cadence:** Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks)
**Window:** March 7 – April 18, 2026

| Week | Date | Session | Topic |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Mar 7 | Session 1 | Introduction to GitHub & Repositories |
| 3 | Mar 21 | Session 2 | GitHub Issues for Task Tracking |
| 5 | Apr 4 | Session 3 | GitHub Projects for Planning |
| 7 | Apr 18 | Session 4 | Collaboration & Pull Requests |

**Block 1 Goal:** Learners can navigate GitHub, create and manage Issues, use Project boards, and collaborate via Pull Requests.

**Notes:**
- Start in early March before planting prep intensifies
- Bi-weekly cadence gives learners time to practice between sessions
- By mid-April, learners have 4 sessions of foundational skills before the planting break

---

### Planting Season Break (May 1 – June 30)

**Duration:** ~9 weeks
**No formal sessions during this period.**

**Bridge Activities:**

| Activity | Timing | Format | Purpose |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| "GitHub Refresher" one-pager | Distributed May 1 | Print + digital | Quick-reference for Sessions 1–4 skills |
| Optional GitHub Discussion prompt | Posted bi-weekly | Asynchronous | Keep learners engaged without time commitment |
| "Try This" micro-challenge | Posted monthly | Text/email | One small GitHub task per month (e.g., "Create an Issue for one farm task this week") |

**Discussion Prompts (examples):**
- "What farm task did you use GitHub for this month?"
- "Share a photo of something on your farm you'd track with an Issue"
- "What's one thing you want to learn in Block 2?"

---

### Block 2: Intermediate Skills (July–August)

**Sessions:** Recap + 5–8
**Cadence:** Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks)
**Window:** July 4 – August 29, 2026

| Week | Date | Session | Topic |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Jul 4* | Recap | 30-min review of Sessions 1–4 |
| 1 | Jul 4* | Session 5 | Notifications & Team Communication |
| 3 | Jul 18 | Session 6 | Basic Workflows & Templates |
| 5 | Aug 1 | Session 7 | Introduction to GitHub Actions |
| 7 | Aug 15 | Session 8 | Automating Farm Tasks |

*\*Recap session (30 min) delivered immediately before Session 5 on the same day.*

**Block 2 Goal:** Learners can manage notifications, create templates, understand GitHub Actions, and set up simple automated workflows.

**Notes:**
- Recap session rebuilds confidence and muscle memory after 9-week gap
- July start avoids most mid-season field work (varies by region)
- If July 4 conflicts with holiday, shift to July 11
- Sessions 7–8 introduce automation — the most technically challenging content so far

---

### Harvest Season Break (September 1 – October 31)

**Duration:** ~9 weeks
**No formal sessions during this period.**

**Bridge Activities:**

| Activity | Timing | Format | Purpose |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| "GitHub Refresher" one-pager (updated) | Distributed Sep 1 | Print + digital | Quick-reference for Sessions 1–8 skills |
| Optional Discussion prompt | Posted bi-weekly | Asynchronous | Maintain community engagement |
| "Harvest Report" challenge | Posted Oct 1 | Asynchronous | "Create a GitHub Issue documenting one thing from harvest season" |
| Train-the-trainer scouting | Ongoing | Instructor observation | Note high-performing learners for potential train-the-trainer |

---

### Block 3: Advanced & Capstone (November–December)

**Sessions:** Recap + 9–12
**Cadence:** Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks), with Sessions 11–12 potentially weekly
**Window:** November 7 – December 19, 2026

| Week | Date | Session | Topic |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Nov 7 | Recap | 30-min review of Sessions 5–8 |
| 1 | Nov 7 | Session 9 | Advanced Projects & Roadmaps |
| 3 | Nov 21 | Session 10 | GitHub Copilot Basics |
| 5 | Dec 5 | Session 11 | GitHub Spark & Agents |
| 6 | Dec 12 | Session 12 | Capstone Project & Train-the-Trainer |

**Block 3 Goal:** Learners master advanced features, complete a capstone project, and top performers are identified for train-the-trainer.

**Notes:**
- November start gives farmers time to finish post-harvest work
- Sessions 11–12 are scheduled weekly (1 week apart) to maintain momentum for capstone
- Session 12 is the capstone — allocate extra time if possible (3 hours instead of 2.5)
- December 19 completion allows holiday break before any follow-up activities

## Recap Session Design

Recap sessions are 30 minutes, delivered at the start of Blocks 2 and 3.

### Structure

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00 (5 min) | Welcome back; acknowledge the gap; celebrate returning |
| 0:05 (10 min) | Quick review: key concepts from previous block (3–5 slides) |
| 0:15 (10 min) | Hands-on refresher: "Show me how to [skill]" spot-checks |
| 0:25 (5 min) | Q&A: "What did you try during the break? What questions do you have?" |

### Key Principles
- **Normalize forgetting:** "It's been 9 weeks — of course things feel rusty. That's completely normal."
- **Rebuild confidence:** Start with the easiest skill from the previous block
- **Don't re-teach:** Review, don't re-deliver. If learners need more, address 1-on-1 during break
- **Celebrate returning:** "The fact that you're here after [planting/harvest] season shows commitment"

## Scheduling Flexibility

| Scenario | Adjustment |
|----------|-----------|
| Late spring (cold region) | Shift Block 1 to Feb–Mar; extend planting break |
| Early harvest (southern region) | End Block 2 by mid-August; start Block 3 in late October |
| Weather emergency | Cancel session; reschedule within 1 week; extend block by 1 week |
| Low attendance (<50%) | Reschedule session rather than delivering to partial group |
| Learner requests weekend | Offer Saturday morning option if majority prefers |
| Holiday conflict | Shift session by 1 week; maintain bi-weekly cadence |

---

## Session Day Logistics

**Recommended:** Saturday mornings (9:00 AM – 11:30 AM)
- Avoids weekday farm work
- Morning hours when energy is highest
- 2.5-hour window fits 150-minute session with arrival/departure buffer

**Alternative:** Weekday evenings (6:00 PM – 8:30 PM) during winter months (Block 3)

**Venue Requirements:**
- Reliable Wi-Fi (test with 25+ simultaneous devices)
- Power outlets for all learners
- Projector/screen visible from all seats
- Tables arranged for pair work
- Accessible entrance, seating, and restrooms

*This schedule should be validated with the actual cohort's availability. Distribute the pre-training survey (see learner-profile.md, Section 9) to confirm blackout periods and preferred session days/times.*
