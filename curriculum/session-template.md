>
> [Insert farm-relevant question that surfaces the problem this session solves]
>
> "Today we're going to learn [topic], which is GitHub's way of [farm analogy]. By the end of this session, you'll be able to [key outcome in plain language]."

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] Open with a farm question, not a technology statement
- [ ] Share the farm analogy for today's concept
- [ ] State 1–2 learning outcomes in plain language
- [ ] Acknowledge any anxiety: "This might feel new, and that's completely fine"
- [ ] Connect to prior session: "Last time we learned [X]. Today builds on that."

### Phase 2: Concrete Experience — Instructor Demo (15 min)

**"I Do" — Watch Me**

Purpose: Demonstrate the skill live so learners see the complete workflow before attempting it.

**Facilitation Script:**

> "I'm going to show you exactly how to [skill]. Watch my screen — I'll go slowly and explain each step. You don't need to follow along yet, just watch."

**Demo Steps:**

1. [Step 1 — describe what to show and what to say]
2. [Step 2]

### Phase 3: Reflective Observation — Guided Practice (20 min)

**"We Do" — Let's Do It Together**

Purpose: Learners follow along step-by-step with instructor guidance and peer support.

**Facilitation Script:**

**Guided Steps:**

1. [Step 1 — include exact instructions learners should follow]
2. [Step 2 — include "checkpoint: you should see [X] on your screen"]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4]

**Pair Activity:**
- Partners compare screens at each checkpoint

**Concept Points:**

1. [Concept 1 — use farm analogy]
2. [Concept 2 — connect to prior session knowledge]
3. [Concept 3 — address common misconception]

**Discussion Prompts:**

## Facilitation Notes

### Pacing Guidelines

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Multiple hands raised | Pace too fast | Pause, re-demonstrate, add checkpoint |
| Learners looking around | Confusion | Stop and ask "What's on your screen right now?" |
| Learners chatting, looking at phones | Pace too slow or content not engaging | Move to practice phase, add stretch challenge |
| One learner far behind | Individual difficulty | Pair with advanced partner, provide 1-on-1 during break |
| Whole group energized, asking questions | Good engagement | Extend discussion, add bonus demo |

### Technology Anxiety Management

- **Session 1 Rule:** No one fails. Every exercise is designed so all learners succeed.
- **Normalize mistakes:** "I click the wrong thing all the time — watch me fix it"
- **Celebrate specifics:** "Maria just created her first Issue — that's a real skill!"
- **Avoid jargon:** If you catch yourself using a technical term, immediately follow with the farm analogy
- **Check in frequently:** "Thumbs up if you're with me, thumbs sideways if you need a moment"

### Cognitive Load Management

- **Rule of Three:** Introduce, practice, reinforce. Don't move on until the majority has it.
- **One screen at a time:** Don't show your screen while learners are working on theirs
- **Written backup:** Every verbal instruction is also on a slide or handout
- **Break momentum:** If energy drops, call a 2-minute "stand and stretch"
