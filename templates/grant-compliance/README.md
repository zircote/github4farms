## How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Create Your Repository

1. Click **"Use this template"** (green button)
2. Name it after your grant (e.g., "EQIP-2026" or "conservation-grant-tracking")
3. Choose **Private** — grant information should be kept confidential
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Set Up Your Grant

1. Edit the **README** to add your grant details (program, amount, dates, contacts)
2. Go to **Issues** → create one Issue per deliverable or milestone
3. Use the **"Grant Milestone"** template for major deliverables
4. Use the **"Reporting Deadline"** template for periodic reports

### Step 3: Track Compliance

- Update Issues with progress comments as work is completed
- Attach supporting documents (receipts, photos, reports) directly to Issues
- Close Issues when milestones are met
- Use the Project Board to see overall grant progress at a glance

### Step 4: Generate Audit Trail

When you need to demonstrate compliance:
- **Issue history** shows when each milestone was created, updated, and completed
- **Comments** provide a timeline of work performed
- **Attached files** serve as supporting documentation
- **Closed Issues** with dates prove when deliverables were met

## Why GitHub for Grant Compliance?

| Traditional Method | GitHub Method |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Paper files in a folder | Searchable digital Issues with attachments |
| "I think we did that in March" | Timestamped record: "Closed on March 15, 2026 at 2:47 PM" |
| Lost receipts | Photos attached to Issues — always accessible |
| Unclear who did what | Every action attributed to a specific person |
| No backup | Cloud-hosted with full version history |
| Hard to share with auditors | Share repository access or export reports |

## Tips for Grant Compliance

- **Create Issues early** — as soon as you receive the grant agreement, create an Issue for each deliverable
- **Attach everything** — receipts, photos, reports, correspondence. GitHub keeps them permanently.
- **Comment regularly** — even brief updates ("Ordered materials today") create a timeline
- **Use due dates** — set milestones with dates in the Project board's custom fields
- **Close with evidence** — when closing a milestone Issue, include a comment with the final documentation
- **Don't delete** — closed Issues are your audit trail. Keep everything.
