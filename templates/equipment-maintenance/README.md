## Tips for Success

- **Log every service** — even oil changes. Small records add up to a complete history.
- **Attach photos** — before and after photos of repairs are invaluable for insurance and resale.
- **Use labels** to filter by equipment type when reviewing history.
- **Search closed Issues** to find past repairs on the same equipment.
- **Set up automation** (Session 8) to create weekly reminder Issues for routine checks.
